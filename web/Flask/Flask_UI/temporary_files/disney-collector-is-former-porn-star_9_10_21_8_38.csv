The story cites anonymous former neighbors who it says confirmed that it is DeJesus' voice on the videos, and that she was a porn actor. It also reported that the ex-wife of DeJesus's partner confirmed that the couple is behind the YouTube account.

Brazilian Daiane DeJeus was named by a family friend as the woman behind the wildly successful collection of children's videos that have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times. And former neighbours of the mysterious internet star have revealed to Daily Mail.com her secret past - which could explain her desire to remain completely anonymous. For years they knew her as Daiane DeJesus who lived in a suburban home with her long-term partner Messias Credido. But they also discovered she was once a porn star called Sandy Summers. Scroll down for video Diane DeJesus in her porn star days (left) and at her local gas station in Orlando recently (right). The Brazilian has been named by neighbours as the woman behind the massively popular DC Toys Collector YouTube account DeJesus' videos, in which a mysterious woman 'unboxes' toys while narrating as she does so, have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times on YouTube, bringing the 29-year-old an annual income of almost $5m The Brazilian went by the name Sandy Summers but is now living under the name Daiane de Jesus Are these the hands of DC Toys Collector? Daiane DeJesus and her husband are apparently behind the site that has become a YouTube sensation Seen here with a Teletubbies toy, the woman's nails always appear differently in each DC Toys Collector video The couple behind DC Toys Collector - previously known as 'Disney Collector' and one of the most popular videos on YouTube - has gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure their identities are not known. Attempts by the New York Times and BuzzFeed website to establish their identity failed, though they were able to pinpoint Florida as the location of those behind the channel - which is nothing to do with Disney itself. But Daily Mail.com has been told the identities of the pair by former neighbours and a close friend - and has used publicly available property records. Former neighbours who listened to the videos of DC Toys Collector are convinced that DeJesus is the voice behind You Tube's most successful channel. They became aware of her career as adult film star after she was spotted taking part in a photo shoot by the swimming pool in her back garden. They also watched some of the graphic adult-only videos and instantly recognised the pouting young blonde as their suburban neighbour. DeJesus, 32, never mentioned what she did for a living and the neighbours never asked. Daily Mail.com tracked DeJesus, who quit the porn industry at least seven years ago, to her new home in an upscale gated community in Orlando, Florida. Four people who were independently shown a photograph of DeJesus taken by Daily Mail.com this week and published here said that it was their former neighbour. They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots. One neighbour who listened to the DC Toys Collector video and said immediately: 'That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere.' The neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to. DeJesus and her partner Messias Credido's old home in Winter Park, Orlando, where porn films featuring DeJesus as Sandy Summers and some of what were known as the Disney Collector videos were both made The DC Toys Collector formula is simple, with the woman simply removing the toys from their packaging, demonstrating each part and sometimes assembling them for the benefit of her massive online audience The videos are essentially a virtual tour of each toy, such as this Play Doh with a Finding Nemo theme Maribel Barreto, an associate and ex-wife of Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido, was approached by Daily Mail.com and showed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. She said they are behind the DC Toys Collector videos In the DC Toys Collector videos only the narrator's hands and the product being unboxed are usually seen This still is from the channel's most successful video, which has been viewed more than 200million times DeJesus' career change means neighbours say she is now the figure behind the most lucrative account on YouTube The user unboxes everything from Disney princesses to tubs of Play-Doh, including this Cars themed toy 'Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange. 'We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on. 'Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers' website and it all clicked into place.' His wife added: 'In the photo you have of Daiane she has put on a bit of weight but that is unmistakably her. 'That is our former neighbour. I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.' Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry. 'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said. Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. The effect [of DC Toys Collector] is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after its over.' When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away. 'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment. But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando. She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.' While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago. Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live. Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus. The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court. Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector. DeJesus as she is today, with the mole near her elbow showing she used to be the porn star Sandy Summers DeJesus was formerly well known as an adult performer (left) but now keeps a far lower profile (right) DeJesus as Sandy Summers by the fireplace thought to be at the Winter Park, Florida home The 29-year-old once made risqu√© videos but the market for her YouTube channel now is toddlers It is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys. Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way. Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido. Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home. 'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour. Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets. But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret. The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012. They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity. The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views. Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million. The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded. One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views. The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day. DC Toy Collector's local Toys R US store where she buys some of the products she features on her channel The branch of Target where Diane DeJesus sources some of the toys for her usually daily video posts Like others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site. With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos. Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid. Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed. Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned. The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m. They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count. I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute. In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice. Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'. The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features. The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting. A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them. The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes. Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'. He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'. Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.' Others have called the DC Toy Collector 'The Toy Whisperer'. The pool and backyard area at the Winter Park house, where Sandy Summers made some of her videos according to neighbours The entrance to the gated community where DeJesus lives and is thought to make her wildly popular toy review videos DeJesus has been able to move to the exclusive area apparently thanks to DC Toys Collector making $5m a year Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida, close to where DC Toys Collector has its headquarters But the couple have gone to great lengths to guard their privacy. No phone number is listed and their names are not even on the phone entry system at the gated community where they now live in Orlando. Property records listed with Seminole County list 44-year-old Credido as the buyer of a four-bedroom home set on a cul de sac in Orlando in April 2013. DeJesus' name does not appear on the records. Neighbours in the development contacted by phone confirmed that DeJesus lives at the address and is mum to an 18-month-old boy. According to fan websites DeJesus, or Summers, began her porn career when she was 20 years old in 2006. She lists her hometown as Lages in Santa Catarina, Brazil, and her date of birth as April 1986. On a webpage called Babepedia she says: 'I was born in a small town in Brazil called Lages. I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place. 'I miss some of my friends in Brazil, but I just love living here! I enjoy the simple life, but big cities have so much to offer; shopping for one! I am a shopoholic, definitely! 'I speak Portuguese and English. What else can I say about myself? Just that I love to get naked.' In her career she has appeared on the cover of Penthouse magazine and other adult magazines as well as dozens of graphic videos. It appears she quit or reduced her involvement in the adult film business in 2009 with one fan asking on a site: 'Anyone know what has happened to Sandy Summers?' Daily Mail.com tracked down Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido's former wife Maribel Barreto Ms Barreto confirmed that Mr Credido and Daiane de Jesus are behind the DC Toys Collector videos. She is pictured being shown a document with the reported annual income of DC Toys Collector But when asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen faced and hurried away Some of the photographs of Summers on adult sites appear to have been taken at their home in Winter Park. Many of the backdrops in the pictures are identical to those now being shown on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale. In one she is draped across a stone fireplace. That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale. DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years. The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive. One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house. 'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.' Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.' Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home. Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it. It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos. Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home. Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced. Her birth date is listed on the official form as April 1982 - four years different that Summer's on adult film websites containing her biography",Brazilian EX-porn star Diane DeJesus is figure behind YouTube'S DC Toys Collector,2015-02-24,Paul Thompson In Orlando
