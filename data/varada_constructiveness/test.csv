Chen, of the federal district court in San Francisco, denied Uber\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment! In his decision, the judge agreed with many of our arguments about why Uber drivers may be properly classified as employees. Click here to read the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision. Under the court\xe2\x80\x99s order, the case will go to trial before a jury. See the news stories below for reports on the ruling. The next step in the case will now be for the court to decide class certification, which would define the scope of the case and which drivers can be covered under it. The court has set a hearing on class certification for August 6, 2015. We expect that Uber will argue that most drivers are bound by an arbitration clause, which prevents them from benefiting from a class action case in court. In another case (which challenges Uber\xe2\x80\x99s background checks), the same judge who is presiding over our case ruled that Uber\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration clause is unconscionable and unenforceable. However, Uber has appealed that decision. In the event that the arbitration clause is ultimately enforced, we plan to file individual arbitration cases for drivers who may be bound by the arbitration clause. So if you did not opt out of Uber's arbitration clause within 30 days of accepting the agreement (and most drivers did not), please CONTACT US so that we can add you to our list of drivers to pursue individual arbitration if we need to do that, so that you can be assured of being covered by the result we obtain. If you accepted an Uber contract within the last 30 days, you can still opt out of the arbitration clause by emailing optout@uber.com and saying you want to opt out of the arbitration clause. IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN IF WE WIN THE CASE, YOU MAY NOT RECOVER ANYTHING FROM IT UNLESS YOU CONTACT US TO SIGN UP FOR ARBITRATION. SO PLEASE EMAIL ELIZABETH LOPEZ, AT elopez@llrlaw.com, TO SIGN UP FOR ARBITRATION, IN THE EVENT THAT WE NEED TO FILE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS FOR DRIVERS. MORE THAN A THOUSAND DRIVERS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED US TO JOIN OUR LIST. In a recent decision, the California Labor Commissioner ruled that an Uber driver was indeed an employee, not an independent contractor, and ordered Uber to reimburse the driver for her expenses. This is the same remedy we are seeking for all Uber drivers in the class action lawsuit. This decision was a great result and may be helpful to our lawsuit. We were very pleased to learn that the California Labor Commissioner agrees that Uber is acting as an employer. However, Uber has appealed the decision, which will be reviewed de novo in court, and so its impact on the class action case is not yet clear. We filed this case on behalf of Uber drivers across the country. In an early ruling, the court agreed with us that the case could proceed on behalf of drivers nationwide. In a later ruling, however, the judge changed his mind and limited the case to drivers in California. We think this decision was incorrect and we plan to appeal it. But meanwhile, if you have driven for Uber anywhere in the United States, and did not opt out of the arbitration clause within 30 days of accepting Uber\xe2\x80\x99s licensing agreement, PLEASE CONTACT US to obtain a form to return to us so that we can pursue an individual arbitration claim for you, in the event that we have to pursue these claims individually, rather than through the class action.

Much of Canada's social progress has relied on this dynamic. However, provincial governments are likely far more jaded at this stage. The cost-sharing model on which medicare was established, for instance, was fairly swiftly abandoned by the federal government, leaving provinces increasingly holding the bag for health care funding, which now eats up about fifty percent of provincial revenues in some jurisdictions.

I watched an 11 or 12 year old girl be sexually assaulted by an older male reserve member and when I called the police, they said they could only attend the reserve if someone on the reserve called. So I stood there in the rain, yelling at the man who had assaulted the young girl and he told me to mind my own business and go away. From my perspective, no amount of money will make the problem of abuse of young girls go away until the attitude on the reserves changes. Last week there was an article in the Globe titled 'The best native leader Canada never had.' It profiled Chief Clarence Louie of the Osoyoos band. Unless there has been no residential school abuse of his band, what is the difference between his band and all the other bands? It seems it is a lack of leadership. Yes, I want this awful abuse to stop happening, but throwing more money at the problem doesn't seem to be the answer. It has to be a change of culture within each individual band. I've met some really strong native women who know what needs to be done, but they are being undermined by a bad, sexist culture on the reserves. Tossing dollars at the problem won't help.

Few born and bred Europeans have easy access to higher education, housing, socialsupport, subsidized daycare spots. Those things have never been just served up ona silver platter even for those who have paid very high taxes all their lives. This goes for Canada as well. We cannot as countries fix all the difficulties for these refugees with one swift move ofa magic wand. We cannot accept an un surmountable number of refugees when so many who already live here are struggling with unemployment, lack of cheap daycare or access to free health and dental care. Our political system is not fool proof even if it seems a better one than the one in Syria. We live with a situation that is not going to be solved over night. And it will certainly not happen any faster if we just open the flood gates and let the masses arrive.

Small Denmark was swamped with 20,000 refugee applications. Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and even Egypt and Iraq have been helping the refugees since the beginning of the crisis (2011). For the most part they permitted Syrians access to their countries and have spent vast amounts of money to support them - some published numbers include Turkey, by the start of December 2014, spent USD 4.5 billion in direct assistance to Syrian and as of mid-2014, tiny Jordan and Lebanon had provided more than US$ 1.2 billion and 1.6 billion respectively.

Small Denmark was swamped with 20,000 refugee applications. Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and even Egypt and Iraq have been helping the refugees since the beginning of the crisis (2011). For the most part they permitted Syrians access to their countries and have spent vast amounts of money to support them - some published numbers include Turkey, by the start of December 2014, spent USD 4.5 billion in direct assistance to Syrian and as of mid-2014, tiny Jordan and Lebanon had provided more than US$ 1.2 billion and 1.6 billion respectively. Many refugees are not interested in leaving the region. Millions want to return home once the war is over and would prefer to stay close to home - little interest was shown in immigrating to Canada when they were questioned last year. And as for complaints by the author that \xe2\x80\x9cMore than 1,000 of the newcomers are living in temporary housing. And we still have a shortage of family doctors, a lack of proper dental care for low-income adults and a lack of subsidized daycare spaces for parents who want to learn English\xe2\x80\x9d. How does that differ from the plight faced by many Canadians? Should refugees be somehow afforded a higher priority than citizens?

Even Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf States do NOT accept refugees, even though they are member states of the UN.I suspect it is this pushy demanding attitude that leads to problems in the Middle East, along with the unsustainable growth in population.

She and the Democratic Party were blind and ignorant of the rejectionist tide sweeping America. They were snobby elites who made vast (as it turned out) fatal assumptions that Obama voters would stay with Hillary.

Remember, Mr. Trump chewed his way through 16 other Republican contenders, most of them men, and probably all of them technically more qualified than he. Much of that spectacle occurred long before it was evident that Ms. Clinton would be the Democratic nominee. You assume, incorrectly, that America is a progressive society. While there are progressive segments, what this election demonstrated is the opposite. Sexism, racism and xenophobia are alive and doing very well there, particularly in the Republican caucus. Further, politics is relentlessly self-serving, at the personal and party level. Also, especially since 2008, economic growth has disproportionately benefitted the wealthy. (That's a big issue on its own, but its relevance here is that the privileged are making the economic and political decisions to their own benefit while the underclass is falling farther behind.) For example, how can America's election campaign funding model be considered fair and democratic? Mr. Trump has ably exploited all these issues. Ms. Clinton, besides being a woman, also became the poster-person for the status quo. In effect her biggest asset - her vast experience - became a liability. Perhaps Bernie Sanders would have been a better adversary, not because he's a guy, but because he also was speaking out about the injustices being suffered by less privileged Americans. Those arguments worked very well for his popularity too, particularly among young women. And, since we're here, Ms. Clinton wasn't so overwhelmingly popular among those younger women. While one can argue with some validity that some women are against a female President, I'd venture that for many of them, other issues are in play. While it is fair to speak out against sexism (and racism and xenophobia) in America and elsewhere, my worry now is that Americans have elected a sorcerer's apprentice. How much damage can this apprentice do? I worry about increasing instability in eastern Europe (in particular). I worry about war over the South China Sea. I worry that the global ecosphere is in deeper trouble now, due to Mr Trump's inappropriate policies on climate change, habitat destruction and unsustainable, profit-driven, wasteful consumption of resources.

And I - who remember when a Walkman was a marvel - thought how odd it was that something so relatively new and amazing was, just a few years later, almost obsolete. How obsolete? Well, Apple has stopped making them. Think about it: they made something that did just one thing and did it brilliantly, allowing users to store an incredible amount of music in a small portable device, but now that's gone, as they try to sell us on other gadgets that yes, will store music, but only a fraction of what the Classic could hold. Like Elizabeth Renzetti, I get by just fine with a Blackberry (for basic communication). I also wear a wristwatch (a Citizen Eco-Drive; never needs batteries), and for entertainment use my iPod Classic. When the Classic packs in I'll only be able to replace it with something that either a) holds a fraction of what the Classic can and/or b) does a whole lot of other things I don't want or need. Which I guess is good for Apple's bottom line, but isn't what I consider progress.""",1,1,1,1,1,1,266,4.285714286,40.4,0.058394161,7,11,29"b'David, don\'t assume that those who criticize create nothing.

The tech revolution is like all revolutions before it. It began with idealism, hope and awesome innovations. Then came the disruptions to the status quo. The arts have suffered dreadfully. Recent reports show incomes for musicians, writers, and artists are way down from a decade ago. But the Tech Rebels scoff at this and call us to look to the Brave New World of Free Information, Art, and Music. One might ask where those who once were paid to write and sing will find money to eat, but that just makes you a reactionary and a counter-revolutionary. Food can now be printed on one's 3-D printer, says the Comrade of Tech. I'm tempted to scoff, 'Let them eat Bits & Bytes', but that is a trademarked name. I listened to Douglas Coupland, who is sounding like a tech party hack more and more, talk about not being able to remember what it was like to not have the Internet. He has a Wired Brain now. And he offered an anecdote to prove it, only the anecdote proved to be vague and flat and unpersuasive (like everything Mr Coupland has written after Generation X).My library has ditched half its collection in the past two years in the naive belief we'll soon be fully digital and want to be fully digital.

Revolutions, as we know, do not lead to utopian worlds where everyone is free and equal.

Aldous Huxley, Douglas Adams, and Neil Postman had it right. We are amusing ourselves to death.
