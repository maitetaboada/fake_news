But the short story associated with Toy Toys comes back several years. The real Lego Group was established in Denmark in 1934 by Ole Kirk Christiansen, an experienced father, and very productive wooden toys. Over a decade, the corporation has successfully sold many bulk-shaped items, from creatures to vehicles.</p><p>The history of legos</p><p>In the late 1940s, the company formed a machine producing the plastic plane, which was regarded as a major version. This particular edition generated a new line of plastic stations that freely paid the business. Then, in 1949, the real Lego team produced the first thing in history, Automatic Union Bricks. Although these are not Lego bricks we have today, these developments have become the way to become a modern Lego. Also in size, style, and function, Integration with a large automated Rock has been customized by the organization. In 1954, the registered company LEGO as a trademark.</p><p>When presenting huge rocks Suite Lego Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, Ole boy, who was now the executive energy agency, with the idea of establishing a game system according to his Lego stone. He selects the real shot of the view in the conversation had a buyer an alien device said that there was no real deal in the aircraft industry. This method produced the first models of Legos. The modern design and structure of the contemporary layout had copyright at the beginning of 1958, and it lasted five years to provide them with proper equipment. Surprisingly, the 1958 bricks still face modern blocks today.</p><p>In the 1960s, LEGO was named the children and universal emotions. At the end of this 10th year, Lego property team was the extra Legos in which 42 nations all over the world have been in the style of Denmarks park which attracted more than half a million visitors in the first year. In the 1970s, Lego separated their children and childrens centers, school readers and senior entrepreneurs. This especially ten years has led to two significant developments in Lego: Lego traditional theme and world-famous legos, also known as figurines or even figurines. The organization continues to grow in the meteoric in the eighth and nineteenth years with expansion in the fields of education, sports, e-mail, published on the official website of Lego and the shops itself.</p><p>In the 1990s, the organization brought one of its most significant risks, which generated large dividends. In 1999, Lego began to use licenses to promote its products. Star Wars, its first certified exhibit will be recorded for the organization. Since Lego offers smart integration with a series of icons and animated film producing theme models, Lego Batman, Harry Potter Legos, Spongebob Lego Indiana Jones Lego, Lego Spiderman, Toy Story Lego and more.</p><p>LEGOs true organization</p><p>Today, LEGOs rights organization continues to grow. In addition to continuous certification contracts, the organization focuses on developing characters and models. Also, they are focusing on new opportunities for journalists, through the introduction of online games, video games, and three attractive DesignByMe, which has an online system offering Lego fans the chance to design and create their own Lego. Only the unlimited reality is customer creativity!

It is filtered to remove any impurities and then mixed with filtered compressed air to give a mixture containing approximately 10% ammonia and 90% air. The exact proportion of excess air depends on the operating pressure and temperature of the plant.</p><p>The mixture is then passed through one or more converters in parallel, each containing a series of 90% platinum/10% rhodium catalyst gauzes in parallel at 975-1225 K - typically 1200 K in a fixed bed reactor. At least 96% conversion of the ammonia takes place.</p><p>Figure 2 A gauze of a platinum-rhodium alloy installed in a converter.</p><p>By kind permission of Johnson Matthey.</p><p>Rhodium is added to the platinum to give the gauze strength and to reduce the loss of platinum, an important economic factor (0.4 g loss per 1000 kg nitric acid made). This is due to 'hot spots' occurring on the gauze.</p><p>Recently, it has been found that knitted gauze increases the efficiency of conversion and prolongs the life of the catalyst.</p><p>Figure 3 Platinum-rhodium wire is woven to produce a knitted gauze.</p><p>By kind permission of Johnson Matthey.</p><p>Care has to be taken to minimise oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen by the even more exothermic reaction, favoured by high pressure and an over-heated catalyst:</p><p>The hot gases leaving the converters are used either to raise superheated steam or to heat the exhaust gas from the absorption tower(s).

The temperature rises to around 435 K and necessitates further cooling to about 310 K. The additional compression and the cooling aid the reactions, moving the following equilibria to the right:</p><p>The gases are then passed through one or more towers to meet a stream of water, normally flowing in the opposite direction to the gas. Here, oxidation of the nitrogen monoxide continues and absorption occurs with the formation of nitric acid:</p><p>Figure 4 Once the reaction between ammonia and oxygen (in the air) is proceeding on the catalytic gauze, the exothermicity of the reaction sustains the temperature and the metal alloy glows red.</p><p>By kind permission of Johnson Matthey.</p><p>In processes where significant NO X remains in the gaseous effluent, the effluent is passed through a catalyst (platinum or rhodium on a silicoaluminate, titanium or vanadium compounds) with a fuel, such as hydrogen or methane. The nitrogen oxides are reduced to nitrogen. For example:</p><p>The temperature at which the reaction is most effective depends on the fuel. For hydrogen, it is ca 450 K. For methane, it is much higher, ca 750 K.</p><p>The acid from the absorption towers contains typically 56-60% nitric acid by mass but can be manufactured up to ca 68% by mass. Some 99% acid is required for the manufacture of, for example, organic nitro-compounds for the explosives and dye industries. Nitric acid and water form an azeotropic mixture, with a maximum boiling point of 395 K, containing ca 68% nitric acid by mass; thus the concentrated acid cannot be obtained by distillation of the aqueous solution. Concentrated sulfuric acid is used to absorb the water content and then on distillation of this mixture, concentrated nitric acid is obtained.

The links in the cellulose chain are a type of sugar: -D-glucose. Two unlinked molecules of -D-glucose are pictured at right [1]. The sugar units are linked when water is eliminated by combining the -OH group and H highlighted in gray. Linking just two of these sugars produces a disaccharide called cellobiose [2]. Cellulose is a polysaccharide produced by linking additional sugars in exactly the same way. The length of the chain varies greatly, from a few hundred sugar units in wood pulp to over 6000 for cotton.</p><p>The cellulose chain bristles with polar -OH groups. These groups form many hydrogen bonds with OH groups on adjacent chains, bundling the chains together. The chains also pack regularly in places to form hard, stable crystalline regions that give the bundled chains even more stability and strength.</p><p>Cellulose is a major component of wood. Cellulose fibers in wood are bound in lignin, a complex polymer. Paper-making involves treating wood pulp with alkalis or bisulfites to disintegrate the lignin, and then pressing the pulp to matte the cellulose fibers together.</p><p>Cellulose is found in large amounts in nearly all plants, and is potentially a major food source. Unfortunately, human beings lack the enzymes necessary to cleave the linkages between the sugars in cellulose. In fact, crystallite cellulose is added to some foods to reduce the caloric value.</p><p>Notes</p><p>Glucose is a six-carbon sugar that comes in two forms with different optical activity. The form, pictured above, has the hydroxide group on carbon 1 on the same face of the ring as the -CH 2 OH group. The form has the same hydroxide group on the opposite face from the -CH 2 OH group. Sucrose, or table sugar, is the most familiar disaccaride, made by linking the sugars glucose and fructose in a different way.</p><p>References and bibliography</p><p>C.

Cigrand asked his students to write essays on the U.S. flag and its significance. This fell on the anniversary of the Continental Congresss vote in 1777 to adopt the Stars and Stripes, and since 1949, Flag Day has been honored every June 14.</p><p>To accompany todays theme, we note that 14 states exempt the purchase of U.S. or their states flags from their sales tax. Such an exemption is poor tax policy: states have exempted nearly 60% of consumer sales from sales tax (more than half), often for political reasons. At the same time, many business inputs are subject to tax, meaning that some retail items are taxed multiple times and some (like flags in 14 states) not at all. This micromanagement of consumer decisions disrupts what would otherwise be decisions made on economic factors, not tax incentives or government prodding.</p><p>Take West Virginia, for instance. Their exemption for flags is the 49th item in a lengthy list of exemptions. In Vermont, its merely the 33rd, but they throw in the wrinkle that its only exempt if sold to (or by) a veterans organization. Another reminder to keep by the register of Vermont flag vendors.</p><p>Heres the full list:</p><p>States That Exempt U.S. and State Flags From Sales Tax</p><p>STATE STATUS CITATION California If sold by a nonprofit veterans organization Cal.

Its birth is usually set at April 3, 1973, when the grocery industry formally established UPC as the standard bar code symbology for product marking. Foreign interest in UPC led to the adoption of the EAN code format, similar to UPC, in December 1976.</p><p>2005 Sunrise and the Global Trade Item Number initiatives from the UCC will begin on January 1, 2005. This is the ""fourteen digit U.P.C."" that everyone is talking about. There are quite a few misconceptions and considerable misinformation about the effect of this change. In a nutshell, if you are a manufacturer of a product that has an existing 8 or 12-digit UPC barcode, don't worry. You do not have to change anything. However, if you are a retailer or wholesaler with scanners, you potentially are affected. You will need to ensure that scanners are able to decode 8, 12, 13 and 14-digit barcodes (most scanners sold for the last 5 years can do this) and that database systems can handle the extra digits. Gregg London was kind enough to share an excellent white paper on the subject. Once January 1, 2005 comes, both EAN and UPC labels should scan properly worldwide.</p><p>There are now five versions of UPC and two versions of EAN. The Japanese Article Numbering (JAN) code has a single version identical to one of the EAN versions with the flag characters set to ``49''.</p><p>UPC and EAN symbols are fixed in length, can only encode numbers, and are continuous symbologies using four element widths.</p><p>UPC version A symbols have 10 digits plus two overhead digits while EAN symbols have 12 digits and one overhead digit. The first overhead digit of a UPC version A symbol is a number related to the type of product while an EAN symbol uses the first two characters to designate the country of the EAN International organization issuing the number. UPC is in fact a subset of the more general EAN code. Scanners equipped to read EAN symbols can read UPC symbols as well. However, UPC scanners will not necessarily read EAN symbols.</p><p>The UPC symbology was designed to make it ideal for coding products. UPC can be printed on packages using a variety of printing processes. The format allows the symbol to be scanned with any package orientation. Omnidirectional scanning allows any package orientation provided the symbol faces the scanner. The UPC format can be scanned by hand-held wands and can be printed by equipment in the store. Version A of the symbology has a First Pass Read Rate of 99% using a fixed laser scanner and has a substitution error rate of less than 1 error in 10,000 scanned symbols.</p><p>Nominal X dimension is 13 mils. A magnification factor of 0.8 to 2.0 is allowed and, as a result, makes a printable range of X dimension values of 10.4 to 24 mils. In other words, the nominal size of a UPC symbol is 1.469"" wide x 1.02"" high. The minimum recommended size is 80% of the nominal size or 1.175"" wide x .816"" high. The maximum recommended size is 200% of the nominal size or 2.938"" wide x 2.04"" high. Larger UPC's scan better. Smaller UPC's do not scan as well or not at all.</p><p>The UPC format can be printed using a variety of printing techniques because it allows for different ink spreading. The amount of ink spreading depends on printing press conditions, amount and viscosity of ink and other factors which are difficult to precisely control. The UPC symbol is decoded by measuring the distance from leading edges to leading edge of bars, trailing edge to trailing edge of bars and leading edge to leading edge of characters. Since relative distances are measured for decoding, uniform ink spread will not affect the symbol's readability. However, excessive ink spread will make the spaces very small to the point that the reader will be unable to resolve them. Since UPC is a continuous code with exacting tolerances, it is more difficult to print on any equipment except printing presses.</p><p>How Do I Get A Bar Code Number For My Product?</p><p>See the FAQ for the answer.</p><p>How Do I Get A List Of All The Product Codes And Their Respective Manufacturers?</p><p>See the FAQ for the answer.</p><p>Do I Have To Pay To Use Barcodes For Internal Uses Like Inventory?</p><p>See the FAQ for the answer.</p><p>UPC Version A Barcode</p><p>UPC version A is the basic version of UPC and is usually the version seen on grocery store items. The symbology is used to encode the 10 digit Universal Product Code. An eleventh digit indicates the type of product, and a twelfth digit is a modulo check digit. The symbol is divided into two halves, each containing 5 digits. The two six-digit patterns are surrounded by left, center and right guard patterns. The left six digits use odd parity encodation while the right six digits use even parity encodation.. The first digit is the UPC number system digit related to the type of product (0 for groceries, 3 for drugs, etc.). The next 5 digits are the UPC manufacturer's code. The first five digits of the right half are the product code. The final digit is the check digit. Although UPC A is continuous, the left and right halves of the symbol can be independently decoded.</p><p>A digit is coded as a sequence of two bars and two spaces within a space 7 modules wide. Bar and space widths may be 12, 3, or 4 modules wide. This results in 20 possible bar-space combinations. Ten of these patterns are used for the left odd parity digits and ten are used for the right even parity digits. The left digits always start with a space, while the right digits always start with a bar.</p><p>Left Digits</p><p>Odd Parity</p><p>S B S B Right Digit</p><p>Even Parity</p><p>B S B S 0 3 2 1 1 3 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 3 1 4 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 3 2 1 1 3 2 5 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 1 6 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 4 7 1 3 1 2 1 3 1 2 8 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 3 9 3 1 1 2 3 1 1 2</p><p>A typical UPC Version A symbol has center guard bars in the center of the symbol which are longer than the other bars. This divides the symbol into a right and left half. This division allows the symbol to scan in any orientation. The moving beam laser bar code reader in grocery stores produces orthogonal scanning beams either in a cross, starburst, or figure-eight. At least one beam will then pass through each half of the symbol, since the symbol's height is at least equal to half of the length of the symbol.</p><p>The height of the symbol should be at least half the length of the symbol. Sometimes the symbol's height is shortened to fit into the design of the package. This truncation of symbol height affects the ability to scan the symbol in any orientation, and will generally reduce the First Pass Read Rate.</p><p>The Quiet Zone should be 9 modules on the left and right of the symbol.</p><p>Version A may include either a 2 digit or a 5 digit supplemental encodation. These extra digits are primarily used on periodicals and books.</p><p>More information about Version A is available here.</p><p>UPC Version E Barcode</p><p>UPC version E is the next most common version of UPC. It is aero suppression version of UPC. It is intended to be used on packaging which would be otherwise too small to use one of the other versions. The code is smaller because it drops outeros which would otherwise occur in a symbol. For example, the code 59300-00066 would be encoded as 593663. The last digit (3 in the example) indicates the type of compression. Guard bars precede and follow the data (no middle guard bars). The digits are coded following the parity pattern EVEN, EVEN, ODD, ODD, EVEN, ODD. The data is enclosed between two left-hand guard bars and three right-hand guard bars. The six digit number is always preceded by a 0 and followed by the check digit. The way the check digit is computed is by expanding the type E to a type A, then doing the regular check.</p><p>More information about Version E along with a converter is available here.</p><p>There is a good explanation of Zero Suppression at the Infinity Graphics site with a table that shows how a Version A number may be reduced to Version E if the Numbering System Character is ""0"".</p><p>Other UPC Barcode Versions</p><p>There are three other versions of UPC. These other versions are not in wide use.</p><p>UPC version B is a special version originally developed to handle the National Drug Code and National Health Related Items Code. It allows for 11 digits plus one product type code. This version does not have any modulo check digit.</p><p>UPC version C is a special code designed to promote industry-wide compatibility. The code is 12 digits long with a product type digit and a modulo check sum digit.</p><p>UPC version D is a variable message length version of UPC. The symbol must contain at least 12 digits. The first digit is a product type code. This is followed by 10 information carrying digits. The twelfth digit is a modulo check sum, and this is followed by a variable number of digits.</p><p>There is a good explanation of the UPC Shipping Container Symbol (SCS) at the Infinity Graphics site.</p><p>EAN-13 Barcode and EAN-8 Barcode</p><p>The EAN Article Numbering System (EAN),the Japanese Article Numbering (JAN) System and the International Article Numbering System (IAN) are identical to UPC except for the number of digits. The Japanese Article Numbering (JAN) System (JAN) codes are the same as the EAN codes, with the flag characters set to ``49''. There are two principal EAN versions.</p><p>Standard EAN (sometimes called EAN-13 or DUN-13) has 10 numeric characters, 2 or 3 ""flag"" characters which are usually a code for the country of the EAN International organization issuing the number , and a check digit. In all other respects, it is identical to UPC version A. JAN is the same as EAN-13. For compatibility with UPC, flags 00, 01, 03, 04, and 06 through 13 are assigned to the United States.</p><p>Lots of people have requested the codes. Here is a partial list. Remember, it indicates the country that issued the code, NOT THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OF THE PRODUCT. The abbreviation ""MO"" stands for Member Organization. The meaning of the prefixes """"020-029"", ""040-049"" and ""200-299"" are set by the GS1 administration in a given country.

The scientist operating the device was John G. Trump, a professor of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Trump was working the controls and explaining how high-speed electrons ran along a porcelain tube to a water-cooled gold target, when suddenly two of the high-voltage sparks hit him squarely on the nose. And yet, according to the A.P. account, the direct strike caused him only slight discomfort. Professor Trump told the reporter, Thats an advantage of this machine. Its completely grounded and those sparks cant kill you.</p><p>If only the same could be said of the Presidential campaign run by Professor Trumps nephew, Donald J. Trump. He is still uncomfortably close to victory, which is why there have been, lately, more serious attempts to figure out what he might do if, say, he had access to nuclear weapons. In his answers, he seldom sounds as ungrounded as when he invokes Professor Trump, the younger brother of his father, Fred. My uncle used to tell me about nuclear before nuclear was nuclear, Trump said in one interview, before nuclear referring, perhaps, to the development of hydrogen bombs, rather than basic atomic bombs (which occurred when Donald was about six years old), or perhaps just to that netherworld where things wait until Trump judges them to be fashionable or flashy enough to exist. He mentions his uncle so often, and in such extravagant termsbrilliant, one of the top, top professors at M.I.T.that it seems worth asking what the professor and his arcane knowledge mean to him. There are two different sets of answers, which might be put into the category of foreign and domestic.</p><p>But first, given Trumps tendency to wrap things in porcelain and gold and shoot sparks through them, its worth noting that John Trump really does seem to have been a brilliant scientist. He was at M.I.T. for decades, and the X-ray machines he helped design provided additional years of life to cancer patients throughout the world, as the Times put it in his obituary, in 1985. Trump was involved in radar research for the Allies in the Second World War, and in 1943 the F.B.I. had enough faith in his technical ability and his discretion to call him in when Nikola Tesla died in his room at the New Yorker Hotel, in Manhattan, raising the question of whether enemy agents might have had a chance to learn some of his secrets before the body was found. (One fear was that Tesla was working on a death ray.) As Margaret Cheney and Robert Uth recount in Tesla, Master of Lightning, Professor Trump examined Teslas papers and equipment, and, in a written report, told the F.B.I. not to worry: Teslas thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character, but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results. Professor Trump may have neglected to make that sort of distinction clear to his nephew.</p><p>What is strange is that Donald Trump couples tales of how he received early, secret word from his uncle that nuclear weapons were dangerous and getting more soHe would tell me, There are things that are happening that could be potentially so bad for the world in terms of weaponry, he told the Boston Globewith a casual indifference about proliferation. In recent interviews, Trump has said that if countries like Japan and South Korea didnt want to pay America more for military protection, they should go and build their own nuclear weapons. When, in one seesawing exchange, Anderson Cooper asked if this meant he was for proliferation, Trump first disagreed, citingnaturallythe professor. I hate nuclear more than any. My uncle was a professor was at M.I.T., used to tell me about nuclear, Trump said. But then he added, Can I be honest with you? Its going to happen, anyway. Its going to happen anyway. Its only a question of time . . . Now, wouldnt you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons? (Actually, no.)</p><p>Its true that nuclear weapons are not that hard for a determined country to acquire, which is why the best counter-proliferation tool is diplomacythat is, deal-making, which Trump prides himself on and yet, in this case, tosses aside. Last week, President Obama attended an international summit on nuclear weapons, in Washington, and said in a press conference that the representatives of other countries had told him they were worried about Trump, who, Obama said, doesnt know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally.</p><p>It gets stranger still when Trump invokes the bomb as a way to dismiss talk of climate change: The only global warming Im worried about is nuclear global warming. Was he thinking of the nuclear winter, but got it backward? Or of the heat generated when bombs, which his uncle told him would be nuclear even before there was nuclear, detonate? It may be, as is so often the case, that looking for the logic in Trumps comments is a pointless exercise. But they might provide an outline, at least, of a world view. When Trump told the Times that his uncle would tell me many years ago about the power of weapons someday, that the destructive force of these weapons would be so massive, that its going to be a scary world, maybe his point was that the world is a scary place, and thus well-suited for a politician like him, who traffics in fear.</p><p>Then there is the domestic side. Trump brings up his Uncle John on subjects that have nothing to do with technology, such as when the Washington Post asked him about his tendency to use crude language and insult people. Trump said that that wouldnt continue when he was Presidentand why not? My uncle, I would say my uncle was one of the brilliant people. He was at M.I.T. for thirty-five years. As a great scientist and engineer, actually more than anything else, Dr. John Trumpa great guy. That was followed not by a quote from his uncle about, say, the importance of treating people decently, but by the simple statement: Im an intelligent person. This is the professors other role in the Trump rhetorical universe: as a sort of eugenic guarantor of intelligence and breeding.</p><p>It is a theme that comes up often. I had a father who was successful, Trump told CNN, in 2010. And, you know, I have a certain gene. Im a gene believer. Hey, when you connect two race horses, you usually end up with a fast horse. In South Carolina, earlier this year, he noted, Dr. John Trump at M.I.T.; good genes, very good genes, O.K., very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart. (Donald Trump was at Wharton as an undergraduate, after transferring from Fordham.) To the Boston Globe: My fathers brother was a brilliant man . . . We have very good genetics. And then on NBC, after telling Lester Holt that his uncle was a professor at M.I.T.: I mean its a good gene pool right therehe pointed to his headI have to do what I have to do.</p><p>Looking at Trumps ideological assemblage, one can see certain common connectorsfatalism, fear, and a social-Darwinists contempt for those who dont do quite as well as he and his family have. Being born rich isnt luck; its something to congratulate oneself on when one looks in the mirror. The opposite is true of the losers. Its part of what can make Trump feel both like a doomsayer and a smug child. In his rallies, he has taken to giving dramatic readings of the lyrics of a song, by Al Wilson, called The Snake, which he presents as a parable about the dangers of immigration: a woman saw a beautiful snake at the side of the road, almost dead from the cold. She took it home, warmed it up, saved its life, and clutched it to her bosomTrump always emphasizes that phrasewhereupon it bit her. As she died from the venom, she asked why. You knew damn well I was a snake! Trump shouts. The world is scary; people dont change. All a Trump can do is ride down an escalator to the lobby in Trump Tower, past the gold fittings and the waterfall, and say that hes running for President. Then come the sparks.</p>",FALSE,irrelevanthttps://www.snopes.com/fact-check/baseball-player-moe-berg-spy/,"Morris ""Moe"" Berg, a multilingual Princeton University graduate who played major league baseball throughout the 1920s and '30s, lived a life of danger and intrigue as a U.S. military intelligence officer in Europe during World War II.",http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/heisenberg-bio.html,"<p>The Nobel Prize in Physics 1932</p><p>Werner Heisenberg Share this:</p><p>Werner Heisenberg - Biographical</p><p>Werner Heisenberg was born on 5th December, 1901, at Wrzburg. He was the son of Dr. August Heisenberg and his wife Annie Wecklein. His father later became Professor of the Middle and Modern Greek languages in the University of Munich. It was probably due to his influence that Heisenberg remarked, when the Japanese physicist Yukawa discovered the particle now known as the meson and the term ""mesotron"" was proposed for it, that the Greek word ""mesos"" has no ""tr"" in it, with the result that the name ""mesotron"" was changed to ""meson"".</p><p>Heisenberg went to the Maximilian school at Munich until 1920, when he went to the University of Munich to study physics under Sommerfeld, Wien, Pringsheim, and Rosenthal. During the winter of 1922-1923 he went to Gttingen to study physics under Max Born, Franck, and Hilbert. In 1923 he took his Ph.D. at the University of Munich and then became Assistant to Max Born at the University of Gttingen, and in 1924 he gained the venia legendi at that University.</p><p>From 1924 until 1925 he worked, with a Rockefeller Grant, with Niels Bohr, at the University of Copenhagen, returning for the summer of 1925 to Gttingen.</p><p>In 1926 he was appointed Lecturer in Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen under Niels Bohr and in 1927, when he was only 26, he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Leipzig.</p><p>In 1929 he went on a lecture tour to the United States, Japan, and India.</p><p>In 1941 he was appointed Professor of Physics at the University of Berlin and Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics there.</p><p>At the end of the Second World War he, and other German physicists, were taken prisoner by American troops and sent to England, but in 1946 he returned to Germany and reorganized, with his colleagues, the Institute for Physics at Gttingen. This Institute was, in 1948, renamed the Max Planck Institute for Physics.</p><p>In 1948 Heisenberg stayed for some months in Cambridge, England, to give lectures, and in 1950 and 1954 he was invited to lecture in the United States. In the winter of 1955-1956 he gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, these lectures being subsequently published as a book.</p><p>During 1955 Heisenberg was occupied with preparations for the removal of the Max Planck Institute for Physics to Munich. Still Director of this Institute, he went with it to Munich and in 1958 he was appointed Professor of Physics in the University of Munich. His Institute was then being renamed the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics.</p><p>Heisenberg's name will always be associated with his theory of quantum mechanics, published in 1925, when he was only 23 years old. For this theory and the applications of it which resulted especially in the discovery of allotropic forms of hydrogen, Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for 1932.</p><p>His new theory was based only on what can be observed, that is to say, on the radiation emitted by the atom. We cannot, he said, always assign to an electron a position in space at a given time, nor follow it in its orbit, so that we cannot assume that the planetary orbits postulated by Niels Bohr actually exist. Mechanical quantities, such as position, velocity, etc. should be represented, not by ordinary numbers, but by abstract mathematical structures called ""matrices"" and he formulated his new theory in terms of matrix equations.</p><p>Later Heisenberg stated his famous principle of uncertainty, which lays it down that the determination of the position and momentum of a mobile particle necessarily contains errors the product of which cannot be less than the quantum constant h and that, although these errors are negligible on the human scale, they cannot be ignored in studies of the atom.</p><p>From 1957 onwards Heisenberg was interested in work on problems of plasma physics and thermonuclear processes, and also much work in close collaboration with the International Institute of Atomic Physics at Geneva. He was for several years Chairman of the Scientific Policy Committee of this Institute and subsequently remained a member of this Committee.</p><p>When he became, in 1953, President of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, he did much to further the policy of this Foundation, which was to invite scientists from other countries to Germany and to help them to work there.</p><p>Since 1953 his own theoretical work was concentrated on the unified field theory of elementary particles which seems to him to be the key to an understanding of the physics of elementary particles.</p><p>Apart from many medals and prizes, Heisenberg received an honorary doctorate of the University of Bruxelles, of the Technological University Karlsruhe, and recently (1964) of the University of Budapest; he is also recipient of the Order of Merit of Bavaria, and the Grand Cross for Federal Services with Star (Germany). He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and a Knight of the Order of Merit (Peace Class).

Vallejo (1808-1890) By Zoeth Skinner Eldredge (1846-1915) Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, born in Monterey July 7, 1808; died in Sonoma January 18, 1890; married in San Diego March 6, 1832, Francisca Benicia Carrillo, one of the most beautiful of the handsome daughters of Don Joaquin Carrillo and Maria Ignaca Lopez his wife.</p><p>Vallejo entered the military service as cadet of the Monterey company January 8, 1824. He was made Alfrez (ensign) July 30, 1827; lieutenant June 22, 1835; captain July 9, 1838; lieutenant-colonel of cavalry May 2, 1842. In 1838 he was made comandante-general of California; and previous to that had been made comandante militar del Frontera del Norte, with headquarters at Sonoma. A commission as colonel of cavalry was sent him September 9, 1846.</p><p>The life of young Vallejo at Monterey was not different from other boys of his class. With young Castro, Alvarado, Estrada, and the rest he went to school to the soldier schoolmasters and as he grew older his desire for knowledge craved other works than the lives of the saints and the doctrina Christiana. Governor Sola took much interest in the boys and helped them to obtain a few books of a more secular nature, and as they grew older they made use of their opportunities in procuring from visiting ship-masters such books as could be had which they carefully concealed from the vigilant eyes of the padres ever on guard to confiscate and destroy books of heretical tendency.</p><p>In 1830 Vallejo was assigned to the San Francisco company of which he was made comandante in 1831. He made several campaigns against the Indians and in 1834 was sent as comisionado to secularize the mission of San Francisco Solano. He was a member of the territorial diputacion in 1827, and for several years thereafter, and in 1834 was granted the Petaluma rancho.</p><p>In 1835 Vallejo was instructed to lay out a pueblo at the Solano mission, was made director of colonization at the north and was authorized to issue grants of land to settlers; the scheme being to prevent, by Spanish colonization, further extension of the Russian establishment of Ross. Vallejo laid out the pueblo and gave it the Indian name of the valley, SonomaValley of the Moon. He labored very earnestly to establish his pueblo and succeeded in attracting a number of families to it. He transferred the San Francisco company to Sonoma and also organized a company of about fifty Indians whom he drilled in the manual of arms. After the neglect of the Mexican government to pay its soldiers had caused the presidial companies to disband, Vallejo supported his military establishment for several years at his own expense. In 1834 he took the preliminary steps for establishing a civil government at San Francisco and on January 1, 1835, turned over to the ayuntamiento the control of civil affairs of that pueblo. He was untiring in his efforts to settle and develop the northern frontier and through his wise management and influence with the Indian chiefs the peace of the frontier was rarely broken. In the rising of Alvarado and Castro against Gutierrez he took no active part, though his sympathies were with his nephew, Alvarado, and he accepted office under the government formed by him. He was now (1837) the foremost man in California as he was one of the richest. Over the hills of his princely estate of Petaluma roamed ten thousand cattle, four to six thousand horses, and many thousand sheep. He occupied a baronial castle on the plaza at Sonoma, where he entertained all who came with most royal hospitality and few travelers of note came to California without visiting him. At Petaluma he had a great ranch house called La Hacienda and on his home farm, Lachryma Montis (Tear of the Mountain), he built, about 1849, a modern frame house where he spent the later years of his life.</p><p>Vallejos attitude towards the Russians at Fort Ross and Bodega was firm and dignified. He maintained that the Russians were on California soil and he notified the Russian manager, Rotchef, that while the use of the port of Bodega by the Russians was tolerated, if he permitted foreigners to land and enter the country in defiance of law he must not be surprised if he found Mexican troops stationed there.</p><p>Vallejo also objected to Sutters establishing an independent principality in the Sacramento valley and his assumption of authority to wage war upon the natives, to grant passports, and to exercise other prerogatives of sovereignty. This made Sutter very angry and he announced that if he were interfered with he would not only defend himself but would declare the independence of California from the Mexican rule.</p><p>We have seen... the ineffectual attempts of Vallejo to revive the military establishment of California. He had cause to be dissatisfied with the administration of Alvarado, who, giving himself up to luxurious ease and dissipation had largely left the management of affairs to the politicians that surrounded him. Juan Bautista Alvarado was a young man of excellent ability, fairly well educated for his time, of handsome person and courteous manners, and of great popularity and influence with all classes. He was born in Monterey February 14, 1809, and was son of Jos Francisco Alvarado and Mara Josefa Vallejo, and his grandfather, Juan Bautista Alvarado, was a soldier of Portols expedition, 1769. Alvarados marriage to Doa Martina Castro, daughter of Francisco Mara Castro, at the mission of Santa Clara August 24, 1839, was a notable event and was attended by all the great in social and political life. Alvarado, who was then governor, was ill at Monterey and was represented by his half-brother, Jos Antonio Estrada, who as his proxy, stood at the altar with the bride. The governor was at this time thirty years of age, and of most distinguished appearance; but already the habit of excessive drinking was upon him and it soon became so confirmed that he was frequently unable, through illness, to perform his official duties.</p><p>Disappointed in his expectation of reform in the government and in the failure of what he considered necessary measures for the national defence, Vallejo wrote the supreme government in 1841 giving his opinion of Alvarados rule, stating his belief that the country was going to ruin, and asking to be relieved of his command. He recommended that the offices of governor and comandante-general be united in one person. Later in December of that year he pointed out to the minister of war the illness of California and suggested the remedy that should be applied. California as a country was nowhere excelled in natural advantages of climate, soil, and harbors, and it had all the elements of a grand prosperity, needing only an energetic population and wise regulations. The land was capable of every product for the welfare of a happy and prosperous people yet they imported most of the articles they consumed. A man free from ties of relationship with the people should be placed at the head of affairs and invested with both civil and military authority; a force of at least two hundred men should be sent in charge of competent officers; the fort at San Francisco should be rebuilt and, a custom-house established there; a colony of Mexican artisans and farmers should be sent to the country to counterbalance the influx of foreigners; and many other recommendations were made.</p><p>The result of Vallejos dispatches was the appointment of Micheltorena to the offices of governor and comandante-general. Having been instrumental in bringing Micheltorena into California Vallejo stood his friend and fed his army, and also loaned him several thousand dollars in money. For this assistance Micheltorena, having no funds with which to pay Vallejo, granted him, in June 1844, the Rancho Nacional Soscol, in what is now part of Solano County.</p><p>In the rising against Micheltorena Vallejo took no part, but he made an indignant protest against Sutters arming foreigners and Indians against his country. He advised Micheltorena that he was well esteemed by the Californians and would be still more highly thought of if he would send his cholos away. He would not take an active part against the governor, but to avoid sending him reinforcements and defend a band of convicts whose presence he deemed a curse to California, he disbanded his Sonoma forces November 28, 1844, and so notified the governor, saying he could no longer support them at his own expense as he had been doing.</p><p>Always friendly to the immigrants Vallejo exceeded his authority in protecting them, and in this and in openly advocating the cause of the United States, his great influence was always used for the American cause notwithstanding the treatment he received. One can hardly conceive a more ungrateful return for the kindness to immigrants and help to Americans than to be seized and confined in a dismal prison by these same immigrants and kept there long after the United States authorities had taken possession and the United States flag was flying over his prison house. On September 15, 1846, he wrote Larkin: I left the Sacramento half dead and arrived here (Sonoma) almost without life, but am now much better. *** The political change has cost a great deal to my person and mind and likewise to my property. I have lost more than one thousand live horned cattle, six hundred tame horses, and many other things of value which were taken from my house here and at Petaluma., My wheat crops are entirely lost for the cattle ate them up in the field and I assure you that two hundred fanegas [about 25,000 bushels] of sowing, in good condition as mine was is a considerable loss. All is lost and the a only hope for making it up is to work again.</p><p>That Vallejos services to the American cause were appreciated by some of the officers is shown by a letter from Captain Montgomery of the Portsmouth dated, September 25, 1846. The Captain sends hearty thanks for the service you have rendered as well as for the prompt and sincere manner in which you were pleased to tender your assistance to the government of the United States in the recent emergency, and to your associates whose ready obedience to your call has done much towards allaying natural prejudices and unfriendly suspicions among the various classes comprising the society of California, and for hastening arrangements for the establishment of peace, order, and good government in the country.</p><p>I quote these letters because they represent the character of the man far better than any words of mine can, and how did the United States requite the services of this man? By passing laws which by their action deprived him of all his property and changed his condition from that of the richest man in California to one of comparative poverty. The land commission confirmed his grant of Rancho Nacional Soscol. The government carried it to the district-court which confirmed the action of the land commission. The government appealed the case to the supreme court which rejected the claim on the ground that the Mexican government gave away its land in California but could not sell government land for food furnished its soldiers. A most astounding decision. In 1863 Congress by special act permitted the holders of Vallejo titles to buy their land at a dollar and a quarter an acre. His great rancho of Petaluma, ten leagues, to which he added five leagues more by purchasesixty-six thousand acresnothing remains but the little home farm and residence, Lachryma Montis. This is the possession and home of his two youngest daughters and the spring which gives it its name supplies the town of Sonoma with water, and the daughters with a small income. The claim to the Petaluma rancho was not confirmed until 1875, after General Vallejo tired of fighting squatters and lawyers had given up his right to the land.</p><p>On December 22, 1846, Vallejo deeded to Robert Semple an undivided half of a tract of five square miles of the Soscol rancho, on the straits of Carquines, for a new city to be built which was to be the great seaport and commercial city of the bay of San Francisco. The town was to be, named Francisca, in honor of Vallejos wife, Doa Francisca Benicia Carrillo. Thomas O. Larkin became interested in the venture and took over the greater part of Vallejos interest. The attempt to appropriate the name as well as the commercial supremacy of San Francisco was frustrated by an order of Alcalde Washington A. Bartlett requiring the name San Francisco substituted for Yerba Buena on all public documents. Doctor Semple was very indignant at this action and spluttered over it in the Californian which he had removed from Monterey to San Francisco. To prevent confusion the name of Francisca was changed to Benicia, the second name of Seora Vallejo. The site for the city was a beautiful one, but trade did not leave San Francisco, though General Persifer F. Smith removed the army headquarters to the city on the strait. The attempt was made to have Benicia named capital of California and General Vallejo made most generous offers to the legislature of land and money if they would move the capital thither.</p><p>Vallejo was a member of the constitutional convention and he applied himself to the work of creating a state with energy and diligence. In common with the other Californians in the convention he endeavored to protect the interests of the natives of the country. The seal of California caused much discussion. Major R. S. Garnett made a design which was accepted, but the members insisted upon the addition of various features. At last when all was agreed the bear emblem was brought forward. Some of the California members were very angry and protested against the bear being used. General Vallejo said that if the bear was put on the seal it should be represented as under the control of a vaquero with a lasso around its neck.</p><p>Bayard Taylor says, writing of the convention:</p><p>One of the most intelligent and influential of the Californians is General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, whom I had the pleasure of meeting several times during my stay in Monterey. As military commandant during the governorship of Alvarado, he exercised almost supreme sway over the country. He is a man of forty-five years of age, tall and of a commanding presence; his head is large, forehead high and ample, and eyes dark, with a grave, dignified expression. He is better acquainted with our institutions and laws than any other native Californian."" Thomes says: (1843) The next morning, when all hands were called I was again dispatched to Seora Abaronos (Briones) rancho for milk, as General M. G. Vallejo was on board and it was necessary to give him a feast, he owning half a million acres of land, and fifty thousand head of cattle, so it was reported. He was a very gentlemanly Mexican, and quite affable to us boys, often giving us a silver dollar for pulling him on board the ship and on shore. William Kelly says: I waited on the general, (at his Sonoma house in 1850) who is an enormously rich man, and was received with the greatest courtesy and hospitality. He is a fine, handsome man, in the prime of life, of superior attainments and great natural talent: the only native Californian in the senate. His lady is also possessed of unusual personal attractions and of that easy dignity and cordiality of manner so peculiarly characteristic of Spanish ladies. His house is a fine one superbly furnished and wanting in nothing that comfort or luxury requires.</p><p>In common with most Californians General Vallejo was most careless and improvident when money was plenty, and while he realized large sums from the sale of lands and cattle, his later years were passed in comparative poverty. The town of Vallejo was named for him and a street in San Francisco bears his name. He, had sixteen children, of whom ten lived to maturity. One daughter married John B. Frisbie, captain of company H, Stevensons regiment, and another married his brother Levi. One married Arpad Harasthy and the two younger daughters married Don Ricardo de Empron and James H. Cutter.

The 400-mile-long Central Valley supplies fully one-quarter of the food America eats. It's a long, mostly flat and incredibly fertile pocket of land nestled between the coastal mountains and the Sierra Nevada range.</p><p>There are no marquee destinations, only sober, business-first cities and vast stretches of farmland and cattle range. But the Central Valley is beginning to change rapidly.</p><p>Families looking for lower-cost housing in California's inflated housing market are trading a three-hour commute to work for a little country space and serenity -- and once-fertile fields are being paved over to make way for subdivisions. Farmers are under increasing pressure to reduce their dependence on chemicals for higher crop yields. And amid all this change, there is a huge Latino population -- many of them illegal immigrants -- whose lack of economic mobility impedes their assimilation into the American melting pot.</p><p>In a series of four reports, NPR's Richard Gonzales and John McChesney profile the promise and pitfalls waiting for the Central Valley as more and more people and businesses discover the ""other California:""</p><p>Part One: The Central Valley's Identity Crisis</p><p>California's Central Valley is growing fast and its biggest industry, agriculture, racked up $27 billion in revenues last year. Yet the Central Valley is often referred to as the ""other California"" or California's ""backyard,"" and the valley's inhabitants are acutely aware that they do not share in the glamour of Hollywood or Silicon Valley. As the population of the valley's cities grows and agriculture's power shrinks, the region's identity crisis has become more acute. Many in the agricultural community have a defensive posture toward the coastal cities -- even while the valley's new urban centers are pushing for a share in the cultural and economic success of the coast. NPR's Richard Gonzales reports.</p><p>View a photo gallery for Part One.</p><p>Part Two: The Problem with Pesticides</p><p>California's Central Valley is the most dynamic agricultural region in the world, yet farmers there are under tremendous pressure from new valley residents relocated from the coast and environmentalists to clean up their act. For decades, farmers have been exempted from clean air and clean water standards that apply to other industries. But now, the state says it is going to bring them into compliance. It's the water standards that have the farmers most worried -- farmers spray on the valley floor a third of all the pesticides sold in the nation. If they have to cut back, farmers warn that prices of tomatoes, pistachios and the 300 other crops grown in the valley will be more expensive. NPR's John McChesney reports.</p><p>View a photo gallery for Part Two.</p><p>Part Three: Central Valley, Going Organic?</p><p>Some farmers in California's Central Valley say they have seen the writing on the wall, and have started efforts to grow without a huge dependence on chemicals. State officials are demanding that farms, exempted for decades, begin to comply with clean air and clean water standards. The birthplace of modern agribusiness, the Central Valley supplies a quarter of the nations' foodstuffs and sets trends for farming nationwide. So when big farms like Muir Glenn tomatoes ""go organic,"" it not only cuts down California water pollution, but it also provides a testbed for the viability of large-scale organic farming. But as NPR's John McChesney reports, going organic is not that easy.</p><p>View a photo gallery for Part Three.</p><p>Part Four: Farm Labor and Illegal Immigration</p><p>In 1949, historian and journalist Carey McWilliams wrote, ""The farm labor problem is the cancer which lies beneath the beauty, richness, and fertility"" of the Central Valley. More than 50 years later, McWilliams would probably come to the same conclusion. By the most conservative estimates, 50 percent of the valley's farm laborers are illegal immigrants -- other estimates run as high as 90 percent. Despite farm labor laws, workers are still subject to sub-minimum wages and dangerous working conditions. Whole towns are virtual labor camps aptly described as ""California's Appalachia."" The region is home to a multi-generational underclass of low-skilled, poorly educated workers and their families. But unlike immigrants of the past, these workers show no sign of being absorbed into an economic track that will improve their lives.</p><p>View a photo gallery for Part Four.</p><p>In Depth</p><p>The New California -- All Things Considered presents a four-part series on the changing demographics in California.

The Xerces Society says its goal is to protect nature's pollinators and invertebrates, which play a vital role in the health of the overall ecosystem.</p><p>The nonprofit organization was involved in the initial petitions to protect the bee species, said Sarina Jepson, director of endangered species and aquatic programs for the Portland, Oregon-based group.</p><p>Jepson said yellow-faced bees can be found elsewhere in the world, but these particular species are native only to Hawaii and pollinate plant species indigenous to the islands.</p><p>The bees face a variety of threats including ""feral pigs, invasive ants, loss of native habitat due to invasive plants, fire, as well as development, especially in some for the coastal areas,"" Jepson told The Associated Press.</p><p>The bees can be found in a wide variety of habitats in Hawaii, from coastal environments to high-elevation shrub lands, she said. The yellow-faced bees pollinate some of Hawaii's endangered native plant species. While other bees could potentially pollinate those species, many could become extinct if these bees were to die off entirely.</p><p>Hawaii-based entomologist Karl Magnacca worked with Xerces on much of the initial research. It has taken almost 10 years to get to this point, he told the AP.

""People tend to focus on the rare plants, and those are important, that's a big part of the diversity. But the other side is maintaining the common ones as common.

""Any research that is done needs a permit from Fish and Wildlife Service unless it's done by a state agency.""</p><p>Koob said that if the bees were removed from ecosystem, the plants that they pollinate would likely not survive.</p><p>""Those plants are not only food and nesting habitat for the bees, but they also provide habitat for other animals,"" he said.
