Here's the root for all the data folders.

## Important notes: 
Please don't GIT ADD the datafiles, just add empty folders with elaborate names. 
Everybody should keep datafiles in their local copy of the repository and share them through other media (uni servers/cloud).
Commiting big files is not recommended in Github.
