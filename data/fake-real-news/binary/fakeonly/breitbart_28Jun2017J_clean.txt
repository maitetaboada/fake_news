Tennyson told police the prospective buyers allegedly grabbed the phone and drove off without paying. Later in the night, Tennyson spotted his phone for sale on the internet and arranged a meeting the sellers, presuming they were the same individuals who had allegedly stolen his phone. When he went to recover his phone he was accompanied by two teammates, O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>montae (Tae) Daley and Frank Coppet, both of whom are 18-years old.
