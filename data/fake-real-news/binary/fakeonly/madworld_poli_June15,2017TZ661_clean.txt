Vladimir Putin is breaking the internet with a statement he just made about former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump and became a disgruntled ex-employee out to screw everyone in the Trump administration. Comey leaked a classified memo to the New York Times, hoping to make Trump look guilty of obstruction of justice. Now, Vladimir Putin just gave Comey a nasty surprise, making him look guilty as hell. The liberal media, along with the Democrats, want everyone to believe that President Trump is in cahoots with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Well, Putin just did something that proves he is delighted by all the negative press and turmoil going on in the United States. Even when politicians joke, they reveal their motivations, and this time, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Putin making a statement that says volumes. Washington Examiner reports, ‚ÄoeRussian President Vladimir Putin reportedly said his country is willing to offer former FBI Director James Comey political asylum if he is prosecuted in the U.S. for leaking his memos on his private conversations with President Trump.‚Äù The report goes on, ‚ÄoeAccording to a translation by RT, a Russian-controlled television network, Putin said Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s leaks put him ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>in a vulnerable position.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> He compared the former FBI director to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who currently has asylum in Russia. Comey, like Snowden, acted as an ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>activist,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Putin said.‚Äù That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not all. Continuing the combative mood, Putin then turned the tables on the US, saying it was the US which has sought to influence Russian elections by funding NGOs [non-governmental organizations] as part of its aspirations for global domination. Putin said, ‚ÄoeTurn a globe and point your finger anywhere, you will find American interests and interference there.‚Äù Those statements don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help Trump, so the liberals can stop with their ridiculous narrative about Russian dominance over the Trump administration. Putin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s comments make Comey look like a traitor, which he is, but they also are in retaliation to the Senate, which just passed more sanctions on Russia for their alleged hacking into the 2016 election. Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s be clear. We don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know who really hacked into the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s emails since the reports on that have been sketchy at best. We do know that any hacking into the 2016 election was not successful, and all intelligence agencies agree on that, even Comey. Ahh haahaahaaa! Time to investigate Comey. Putin his friend. ‚Ä" Lorijoe () June 15, 2017 It is time to investigate James Comey and Loretta Lynch and fire Robert Mueller, who was appointed as a special prosecutor and has just hired Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attorney and four other attorneys who are known backers of Barack Obama. Mueller is also best friends with James Comey, so this is not the man to investigate anything. Gregg Jarrett, an attorney specializing in Constitutional law, says Mueller has got to go. Jarrett made this sarcastic claim, ‚ÄoeLegal Notice: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Proudly Announcing The Newly-Formed Law Firm of Mueller & Comey. We Specialize In Bungling Cases, Ignoring Legal Standards, And Bringing Down Presidents.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>‚Äù Jarrett went on, ‚Äoe[Mueller] has a flagrant conflict of interest that disqualifies him from serving. To wit, his personal and professional closeness to Comey. They have long been allies.‚Äù Vladimir Putin is not acting in concert with Donald Trump as many delusional mainstream media outlets want you to believe. Trump is a loyal and patriotic American, and while he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want Russia as an enemy, he isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t working to make Russia great again, either. The problem isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t Putin, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s James Comey, who committed a felony when he leaked information to the NY Times, and Loretta Lynch, who Comey says ordered him to ‚Äoestand down‚Äù on the Hillary Clinton case, and he did. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to stop the shenanigans by the Democrats on Capitol Hill. Indict Comey and Lynch and get rid of Mueller. Only then will we see justice served, or we might see Comey flee to Russia. Whatever the case, Americans are sick and tired of this crap. Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s get back on track and start making America great again.
