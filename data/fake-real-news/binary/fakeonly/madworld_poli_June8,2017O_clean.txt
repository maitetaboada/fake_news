Senator Kamala Harris has been in the national spotlight more than she would like recently. Unfortunately for her, being put in her place yesterday was the least of her worries as she just humiliated herself again, this time while speaking with former FBI Director James Comey ‚Ä" and the best part is, it happened on live television for the world to see. Mad World News reported yesterday about Senator Harris after she decided to try to intimidate the man she was questioning, who just so happened to be Admiral Mike Rogers. However, her rude tactics of talking over the Admiral were cut short as she got a nasty surprise. As it turns out, Committee Chair Richard Burr cut her off and basically told her to shut up. In all, Burr informed Harris that she was being disrespectful by not letting the Admiral answer the very questions she was asking and to allow the man proper time to respond. Of course, video of the matter went viral as the entitled liberal got put in her place. Too bad for Harris, it seems that the public spankings were just the beginning as the second wave of humiliation just came along ‚Ä" and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all her own fault. Most of the country is aware that former FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress today. Well, as one would imagine, Harris once again got a chance to launch a few questions, but rather than make a point, she managed to stick her foot in her mouth instead. As was seen on live television and later shared to Twitter, Harris decided that instead of asking questions for a moment, she would try her hand at an analogy ‚Ä" and it spectacularly backfired. The entitled Senator decided to compare President Donald Trump to a robber, as Breitbart reports, but it didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go as planned. Sen. Kamala Harris seems to compare Trump to an armed robber saying "I hope you will give me your wallet" #ComeyTestimony ‚Ä" Mike Ciandella ŸÜ () June 8, 2017 Wildly connecting dots that weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t there in the first place, Harris tried to make it look as though Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s comment, which he expressed to Comey, where he said he ‚Äoehoped‚Äù nothing would come out of the investigation into General Flynn was really a demand. Pointing out that she used to be a prosecutor, she said, ‚ÄoeWhen a robber held a gun to somebody‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s head and said, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I hope you will give me your wallet,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> the word hope was not the operative word at that moment.‚Äù Now, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know about you, but I have never heard of an instance where a robber said, ‚ÄoeI hope you give me your wallet‚Äù ‚Ä" and you know why that is? Because it never happens. When robbers want something, they clearly demand that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s handed it over. So, unsurprisingly, Harris‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> analogy fell apart as she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want Comey to answer and quickly shuffled onto her next irrelevant point. However, the remarks were heard, and even Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s son, Donald Trump Jr. decided to weigh in. Taking to Twitter, he calmly explained: 1/3 Flynn stuff is BS in context 2 guys talking about a guy they both know well. I hear "I hope nothing happens but you have to do your job" ‚Ä" Donald Trump Jr. () June 8, 2017 2/3 very far from any kind of coercion or influence and certainly not obstruction! ‚Ä" Donald Trump Jr. () June 8, 2017 But, he saved the best for last: 3/3 Knowing my father for 39 years when he "orders or tells" you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means ‚Ä" Donald Trump Jr. () June 8, 2017 Just like that, Harris was, once again, left humiliated after her stunt on live television ‚Ä" and it all came by her own hand. At this point, liberals better get used to losing because they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re doing it all the time. Even worse yet, it always seems to be their own fault. Try to make this something it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not all you want, but Trump didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do anything wrong. It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter how hard they try to cherry pick the facts or pervert the truth, the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lies will only continue to come out and bury them in the process. The Trump train is barreling down the tracks. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to get out of the way or get run over. Of course, they could just do what Harris is doing ‚Ä" tanking her career and ensuring she won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be voted back in next election cycle. If that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the case, we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to worry about anything as the swamp is going to quickly drain itself and Democrats are going to have their hands full trying to wipe the egg off their face in the meantime.
