It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take a genius to see that the mere sight of the Trump family is enough to get under liberals‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> skin. However, the left has stooped to new lows, claiming that First Lady Melania Trump actually stole something from a British royal just days before returning from her overseas trip ‚Ä" and they say they have the pictures to prove it. President Donald Trump made waves on his trip across the world with many people rating it a genuine success. Of course, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only true if you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t suffer from ‚ÄoeTrump Derangement Syndrome‚Äù because those liberals will find a problem with the man breathing. However, what fewer people are talking about is the impact that Melania made on the trip, advocating for women‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rights and sick children. Sadly, desperate leftists have still found something to complain about even though the First Lady was nothing but kind, courteous, and diplomatic. According to Yahoo News, it seems that Melania actually committed theft against one specific British royal just days before she came home. In fact, the news organization released a series of 8 photographs claiming to demonstrate that the First Lady ‚Äoestole‚Äù the fashion style of Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton. The realization was apparently made as Melania was abroad and wearing an outfit that must have reminded someone of something Middleton once wore. Grasping at straws, liberals then went back through history to find a few dresses that looked even slightly visually similar. As can be seen, all the pathetic claim has to offer is the fact that the two wore the same color outfits at some time or another. Without dates though, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s impossible to tell who actually wore it first ‚Ä" but that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really beside the point. When it comes down to it, liberals are showing just how petty they have become with this stunt. In fact, Biography reports that Melania Trump was already at the top of her modeling career when Middleton had just gotten out of high school. In the end, everyone has their own fashion sense, but all it takes is a quick look around to see that some things are just a general trend of the times. Of course, you throw in there the fact that most people aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t as rich as the Trumps or British royalty and you can see why their desires might align. Fashion preferences don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ‚Äoebelong‚Äù to anyone, and if you really want to get down to it, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s probably that Middleton acquired a taste similar to Melania‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s, who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s older and has been in the fashion world far longer. Either way, it really doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter, but there is a point to be made here ‚Ä" and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s that the left is hopelessly and desperately pathetic. To make a point about these vaguely similar outfits not only shows their petty nature but it warrants anything else they have to say about the Trumps completely and entirely irrelevant. If you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to comment on how someone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dressed before giving them credit for the good that they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re doing, then be prepared to get discarded as the human waste that you are.
