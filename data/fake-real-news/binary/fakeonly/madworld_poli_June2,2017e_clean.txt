Megyn Kelly found herself a cozy position at NBC since leaving FOX News, but things have most recently taken an unforeseen turn. As it turns out, viewers were left shocked after a teaser for her interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin was released ‚Ä" and now, people are calling her a ‚Äoehooker‚Äù after seeing just one shocking thing. As much of the country is well aware, Kelly didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think too fondly of President Donald Trump during his campaign and even went so far as to bash the man several times. Unfortunately for her, he won, prompting FOX News viewers to put up a stink pertaining to her position with the company. After a few other issues, she was eventually let go, prompting her to seek employment elsewhere. Sure enough, she soon announced that she was pleased to be working for the leftist NBC network. Most recently, though, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been teasing an interview she held at the Konstantin Palace in St. Petersburg with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, it seems that everyone wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t as focused on what they were discussing as they were something else. In fact, The Gateway Pundit has gone so far as to say that Kelly was ‚Äoedressed like a high-class hooker‚Äù for the interview. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no denying that she is an attractive woman, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hard to take her seriously as a journalist in this attire. As can be seen in the images she personally released, Kelly decided to wear a low-cut, off the shoulder, blue velvet dress that is slit up the thigh almost to her crotch, accented by black open-toe shoes with stiletto heels ‚Ä" something you wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expect a woman to wear in a professional setting. Megyn Kelly launches new NBC Sunday night show with Vladimir Putin interview ‚Ä" Telegraph News () June 1, 2017 NBC News posted a video clip of Kelly meeting Putin and Modi. Modi is heard commenting that he had seen Kelly‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoepage‚Äù with a photo of her holding an umbrella. Kelly asks Modi if he is on Twitter. Modi laughs and says yes. (if Kelly had done her homework she would know Modi has over 30 million followers of his Twitter account.) Kelly then turns to Putin and purrs, ‚ÄoeVladimir, Vladimir.‚Äù Putin speaks and is translated but it is hard to hear what was said. Kelly laughs and says to Putin, ‚ÄoeAre you ready for me?‚Äù [Source: The Gateway Pundit] EXCLUSIVE: NBC News' joins Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi ahead of tomorrow's International Economic Forum in Russia. ‚Ä" NBC News () June 1, 2017 Of course, Kelly is no stranger to criticism for her less-than-conservative outfits as she caught heat for a skimpy dress she wore during a presidential debate last year as well. Even then, people said she looked like she was working for an ‚Äoeescort agency.‚Äù Does Megyn Kelly have a pool party she needs to rush to after her convention report tonite? Her outfit suggests yes. ‚Ä" stuart emmrich () July 21, 2016 Still hard to take your coverage seriously when looks like she's working for an escort agency. ‚Ä" Susan MacLaren () July 21, 2016 Perhaps her taste for revealing clothing even helped contribute to her parting ways with FOX News in some small way. Regardless, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s clear at this point that her former fans have absolutely turned on her, unwilling to put up with her any longer. At least she used to be reporting in a way that her audience used to appreciate ‚Ä" until, that is, her true feelings about Donald Trump came to light. It was at that time that everyone knew she was putting on a fa√ßade for the big bucks she was being paid to bring in fans. Popularity can be a powerful thing, but you better be on the right side of things. After all, if you aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t, one day you could be dressing like a ‚Äoehigh-class hooker‚Äù while speaking to foreign dignitaries. At that point, all you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re really doing is selling your body for a few extra viewers ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about as disgusting as it gets.
