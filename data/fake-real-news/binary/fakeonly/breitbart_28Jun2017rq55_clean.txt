The incident is currently under investigation, with an ABC News report claiming, â€oeThere was no evidence that any particularly sensitive or operational systems were breached.â€ â€oeInstead, authorities believe only a less sensitive, business-associated side of systems was compromised in at least one breach detected over recent months,â€ they explained. In December, the United Nations warned that terrorist groups were attempting to hack nuclear power plants in a â€oenightmare scenario,â€ while on Tuesday, Chernobylâ€<sup>TM</sup>s radiation monitoring system was hit by a cyber attack. â€oeSystems usually used to monitor the area around the power station â€" which is still an active and dangerous area following the disaster in 1986 â€" are not working because of the cyber attack, Ukrainian authorities said,â€ The Independent reported. â€oeThose areas must now be monitored manually, according to a statement.â€ In March, the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command warned that the increasing frequency of drones carrying out â€oeunauthorized intrusionsâ€ over nuclear facilities posed a â€oegrowing threat.â€ â€oeOf recent concern have been the unauthorized flights of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) over Navy and Air Force installations,â€ declared Gen. John E. Hyten to Congress. â€oeThese intrusions represent a growing threat to the safety and security of nuclear weapons and personnel.â€ â€oeWe are continually assessing threats to ensure our security apparatus is capable of denying unauthorized access or use of nuclear weapons,â€ he continued, before adding that they are working on â€oecounter-unmanned aerial system defenses,â€ that will â€oeeffectively detect, track and, if necessary, engage small UAS vehicles.â€ Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
