President Donald Trump is playing hardball against the ‚Äoedeep state‚Äù operatives trying to take him out, and one move from our Commander-in-Chief included the nasty surprise he just gave James Comey, causing the former FBI Director to go into a complete meltdown. Comey just made a shocking announcement that is freaking out Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enemies, including the Democrats and the liberal press. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. To understand the firing of James Comey and the immediate aftermath, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s important to realize what is truth and what is fiction. First, Comey was not investigating Donald Trump as the fake news media wants you to believe. Secondly, the only ongoing investigation by the DOJ into Russia has to do with the alleged hacking by Russia into the Democratic National Committee. The truth is coming out, revealing that deep state operatives, those burrowed inside the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are trying to setup Trump using Lt. Gen. Micheal Flynn. Remember, Flynn was the subject of an investigation when he was illegally unmasked by DOJ deep state operatives and found to be talking to a Russian Ambassador. However, talking to a Russian Ambassador is not a crime, but the left spun the story to make it seem like Trump was colluding with Russia. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a completely bogus story. This is where Sally Yates, who Trump fired as acting Attorney General, comes in. Yates was in cahoots with Bill Priestap, Asst. Director of Counter Intelligence. Bill Priestap is married to Sabina Menschel, a self-employed ‚Äoeconsultant‚Äù with a history of donations to Democrat candidates; specifically, Hillary Clinton as The Conservative Treehouse reports. It was Yates and Priestap who went to the White House and told Trump about Flynn, hoping the president would immediately fire Flynn. Why? If Trump had immediately fired Flynn back in December, it would look like Trump was trying to impede the FBI investigation. It would look like Trump was overreacting and getting rid of Flynn because he was scared of the bogus Russia collusion story. Comey was in on this, as The Conservative Treehouse illustrates. If you were President under those circumstances, wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you ask FBI Director James Comey what the deal was with these investigations, and whether or not you were under investigation BEFORE you took action to retain or fire Mike Flynn? Given the circumstances, it could appear, and most definitely should be considered, that the President was being ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>set-up‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> to impede an FBI investigation by taking action against Flynn. If Trump took action ‚Ä" What mechanism was in place for the President to protect himself from accusations of impropriety and impeding an investigation? Yates, Priestap, and Comey were all political operatives, colluding together to take out Trump. It makes sense that Trump announced in his letter, firing Comey, that Comey had told him three times he was not under investigation. Then, Trump dropped this nasty surprise in a tweet that had liberals fuming. But, the best part is Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s response. James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 12, 2017 So, what is Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s response? Comey has just announced he will not testify in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee next week. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right, Comey is refusing to go under oath or give any testimony. It sure looks like Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s truth bomb about taped conversations did the trick, stopping Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s continued political game playing. ‚ÄoeJames Comey has told Senate Intelligence Committee aides that he won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t testify in a closed hearing next week about alleged ties between Russia and Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presidential campaign. The committee‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s top Republican and Democrat had invited the former FBI director to Capitol Hill to appear behind closed doors next Tuesday,‚Äù reports Daily Mail. Wow. Trump does it again. He plays the players and shuts down Comey by just implying that he may have tapes of their conversations. You see, Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s second in command, Andrew McCabe, told Trump through Reince Priebus that the whole FBI investigation into a Trump-Russia collusion story put out by the NY Times was ‚Äoebogus.‚Äù The White House's version of the FBI & WH discussing an ongoing (if unacknowledged) FBI investigation of the WH. How is this exculpatory? ‚Ä" Spencer Ackerman () February 24, 2017 It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a political witch hunt in which the Democrats, along with the deep state operatives still in the FBI and DOJ, are hoping to frame Trump in hopes of impeaching him. However, Trump proves he is five steps ahead of them and has the one thing on his side that they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t, the truth. President Donald Trump is up against the rats who are lying to Americans hoping to take him out. Spread this information so other patriotic Americans will learn the truth and these deep state operatives and lying liberal media can be stopped once and for all.
