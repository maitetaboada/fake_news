President Donald Trump is on a roll this week, and the Democrats are grasping at straws after Former FBI Director James Comey had a meltdown on Capitol Hill. Nancy Pelosi was trying to do damage control as she bashed the president in a tongue-tied incoherent rant on MSNBC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Morning Joe. Well, Trump had heard enough, so he sent Pelosi a nasty surprise, making her completely lose her cool. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Nancy Pelosi joined the somber Morning Joe crowd on MSNBC this morning, but she should have stayed in bed. Pelosi was incoherent and tongue-tied as she launched into a strange tirade about President Donald Trump. The hosts, Mika Brezinski and Joe Scarborough, were in ‚Äoela-la‚Äù land, trying too hard to convince themselves that ‚Äoethe president is in a lot of trouble after Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s testimony,‚Äù with Mika going as far as to say ‚Äoeimpeachment.‚Äù Then came Pelosi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ramblings, which end with her telling the president, ‚ÄoeGet some sleep. Get yourself to a place where the synapses are working.‚Äù Oh, the irony, when it was Pelosi who was mixing up her words and had to be corrected. Then, she went off on a weird conspiracy, breathlessly talking about Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s visit to Saudi Arabia. ‚ÄoeHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Friday she finds it ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>strange‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> that President Trump decided to make Saudi Arabia his first foreign trip, adding that she was looking into it. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I just think it was a very strange choice to go there,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, said on MSNBC,‚Äù reports The Washington Times. Pelosi was so frustrated by how terrible she came off that, as Trump sent her a nasty surprise, she lost her cool and immediately tweeted this: If you want to work in the Trump WH, know your blood type. will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat. #MorningJoe ‚Ä" Nancy Pelosi () June 9, 2017 It was a very bad day for Nancy Pelosi, Chucky Schumer, Maxine Waters, and all the liberals in the mainstream media, who were devastated by Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s horrible performance, even admitting he, himself, is a leaker to the press. Morning Joe was like the Titanic with Nancy Pelosi as the captain with no answers and no way to plug the damage to their sinking ship. President Trump was quiet during the Comey hearing, and he let his son Don Jr. take the reins on social media to respond to the idiocracy most of the day. But, after Pelosi had her debacle, Trump sent out two tweets meant for Nancy and her cohorts in the lying mainstream media. Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication‚Ä¶and WOW, Comey is a leaker! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 9, 2017 Did I miss something or did Comey just say he asked a friend to leak information to the press? Is this a joke? ‚Ä" Donald Trump Jr. () June 8, 2017 Then, the second tweet was a real nasty surprise for Nancy and the Democrats, who refuse to get into reality about their Russia conspiracy that is dead on arrival. Trump linked to the famous liberal Democrat Alan Dershowitz‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s conclusion on Comey and the Democratic dreams of getting rid of Trump. We should stop talking about obstruction of justice. No plausible case. We must distinguish crimes from pol sins ‚Ä" Alan Dershowitz () June 9, 2017 You cannot have obstruction of justice when the president exercises his constitutional authority to fire the director of the FBI. ‚Ä" Alan Dershowitz () June 8, 2017 Dershowitz is a liberal but an honest one, and he won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t lie to advance a political party. ‚ÄoePresident Trump could have just pardoned former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and stopped the FBI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s investigation into Flynn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s conversations with the Russian ambassador. The president has the authority to direct the head of the FBI to stop investigating anyone,‚Äù Dershowitz explained on ‚ÄoeYour World‚Äù today. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been saying this for months.‚Äù Dershowitz added, ‚ÄoeI think this puts an end to any claim that President Trump obstructed justice. You can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t obstruct justice by simply exercising your power under the Constitution.‚Äù Ouch, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s got to hurt Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, two of the biggest liars who knew all this time that there was never any investigation into Trump. Why? Because, as Dershowitz says, he was just doing his job, and instead of stopping the Flynn investigation, he let it go ahead. The Democrats and their partners in crime in the mainstream media are wrecked and scrambling to come up with another narrative, which may be why Pelosi widened her eyes and said, ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m looking into Saudi Arabia.‚Äù Let Nancy go ahead and knock herself out with that one, talk about crazy ideas. The stock market soared yesterday, which is the response to Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bad day. They know Trump will be there for a very long time, without any doubts. Patriots across the country rejoice as the Democrats implode once again, and we can look forward to more winning, big tax cuts, and making America great again.
