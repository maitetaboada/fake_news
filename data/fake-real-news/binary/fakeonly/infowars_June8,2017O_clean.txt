A lot of media attention was given to the claim by President Trump that former FBI Director James Comey had told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation by the FBI. It also got attention because Trump implied there might be tapes of these encounters, but thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s another issue altogether. Many people seemed to be flat out denying Trump was telling the truth about these notifications. Well, as it turns out, he was. And if you read the entire statement, it seems as if itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s going to turn out to be of great benefit to Trump. He never asks Comey to stop investigating the Russia concerns. In fact, he seems to want him to get to the bottom of things so that he can be cleared and move on with the business of running the country. This does not read like the actions of a man who is trying to stop an investigation. Yes, he does seem troubled by the slow speed, but who wouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t be? Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m frustrated as well, so I can only imagine how Trump feels. It looks like the media and the Democrats have overplayed their hand once again. Weâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll know more after Comeyâ€<sup>TM</sup>s testimony on Capitol Hill tomorrow.
