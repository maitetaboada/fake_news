Hillary Clinton has come out of the woods again, and this time she is getting on everyone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s last nerve, including her Democratic cohorts. Many are questioning her sanity and her sobriety, too. Hillary just went on a bizarre tirade in public against President Donald Trump, leaving him no choice but to slap her back into reality hard. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Hillary Clinton is mirroring Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s behavior in many ways. Hillary is the loser candidate who refuses to accept the election results. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really taking it to levels of the absurd, and she seems to be ‚Äoedrunk tweeting‚Äù at President Donald Trump. ‚ÄoeWednesday in Palos Verde, CA at the annual Code Conference, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said the barrage of ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>fake news‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and hacked emails released during the 2016 presidential campaign had to have been from the Russians and ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>guided by Americans,'‚Äù reports Breitbart. ‚ÄoeGuided by Americans‚Äù is code for guided by Donald Trump. But, Hillary goes full conspiracy theory when she described a tangled web that no one could decipher at the Code Conference as Conservative Treehouse reports, ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the DNC, the Macedonians, the Russians, the frog memes, some mysterious group called the alt-right, a guy named Pepe, Breitbart Media, Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer and some British data-mining operation, Cambridge Analytica. Them. Weaponized cads. Good Grief.‚Äù Good grief is right. Hillary has been on a roll, blaming everyone and everything but herself. At Wellesley College, her own alma mater, she lashed out again at Trump voters, and her bitterness at the ‚Äoedeplorables‚Äù is reaching new levels. ‚ÄoeIn her remarks, Hillary criticized ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>people‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> ‚Ä" aka Trump followers, presumably ‚Ä" on social media for ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>sowing division at a time when we desperately need unity,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and then proceeded to give a highly partisan and divisive speech,‚Äù reports Fox News. Hillary made all of these remarks in just the last few days. She is now so mentally unhinged that sources close to her say she is drinking, again. Hillary herself said she ‚Äoeneeds her Chardonnay,‚Äù during the Wellesley address. Well, President Trump has had enough of the ‚ÄoeHillary conspiracy tour‚Äù as she insinuates that he and his campaign were working with the Russians. Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC. ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 1, 2017 Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right, Hillary is also blaming the Democratic Party, saying they were terrible and broke. She blamed Facebook, saying the Russians were paying fake news sites to post stories about her email scandal that were just not true, that the email ‚Äoesituation‚Äù was just a ‚Äoenothing burger.‚Äù Then, she responded to Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tweet, and here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s where sources say she really was drunk and not thinking this through. People in covfefe houses shouldn't throw covfefe. ‚Ä" Hillary Clinton () June 1, 2017 By now, you know ‚Äoecovfefe‚Äù is presumably a Trump ‚Äoetypo,‚Äù and the president was the first one to laugh at himself, later tweeting, ‚ÄoeWho can figure out the true meaning of ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>covfefe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> ??? Enjoy!‚Äù Yet, Hillary thinks she is super sly and sarcastic with this remark. We think she is pretty lame and was drunk. What house is Trump living in? Oh yea, the White House. Trump supporters across the country also had something to say to Hillary‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoecute‚Äù tweet to Trump. People who have committed covfefes, like deleting 30,000 emails, should be locked up in covfefes. ‚Ä" #ThePersistence () June 1, 2017 Hillary makes fun of Trump's typo> "Covfefe". At least he's in the White House, unlike you Hillary! ‚Ä" LisaM. () June 1, 2017 Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bitterness is not dissipating. Instead, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s getting worse. Usually, people get over things with time, but Hillary is ramping up her anger as days go on. This would happen if she was masking her emotions with alcohol or prescription medications; all that does is keep the defeat fresh because you never confront it. Whatever the case, she needs an intervention. Bill and Chelsea need to get her into an inpatient locked program so she can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t leave. She obviously is suffering from ‚ÄoeTrump Derangement Syndrome,‚Äù and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only getting worse. Americans don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to hear her nonsense anymore, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re too focused on supporting our president in the White House as he makes America great again.
