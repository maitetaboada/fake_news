In January 2016, Seattle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s minimum wage jumped from $11 to $13 an hour for large employers, marking the second big increase in less than one year, as well as the highest minimum wage in the entire country. However, after effectively demanding to make more money that a paramedic, entitled young ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>FightFor15‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> brats are now learning a brutal lesson. According to new research released Monday, Seattle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s minimum wage hike has come with a significant cost, just as its opponents predicted it would. A team of economists at the University of Washington have found that the sharp increase led directly to a steep decline in employment for low-wage workers, and a drop in hours for those who were lucky enough to keep their jobs. ‚ÄoeThe goal of this policy was to deliver higher incomes to people who were struggling to make ends meet in the city,‚Äù said Jacob Vigdor, a University of Washington economist who helped author the study. ‚ÄoeYou‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got to watch out because at some point you run the risk of harming the people you set out to help.‚Äù Crucially, the negative impact of lost jobs and hours more than offset the benefits of higher wages ‚Ä" on average, low-wage workers earned $125 per month less because of the higher wage, a small but significant decline.

Frankly, it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take a seasoned economist to put two and two together and figure out that employers would not be able to withstand such a financial blow to their bottom lines. A minimum wage job was never meant to be a long-term career choice which could sustain a family, but rather, a good option for young people going through school as they finish their education or master a trade. If you want to make more money, you simply must earn that privilege through hard work. A person whose skill set maxes out at flipping burgers and frying potatoes should not command a higher hourly wage than an individual with the expertise and knowledge to save lives. Perhaps if these low wage earners put the same effort into their jobs as they did at these senseless protests, their wages would naturally rise on their own, but we all know this has nothing to do with actually earning a higher wage. They just want free stuff and feel entitled to it.
