Tuesday after the Republican Senators met with President Donald Trump to discuss the issues that forced a delay of the vote on a Senate Republican health care bill until after the July 4 recess, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said he would prefer not to work with Democrats on the matter. McConnell said, ‚ÄoeI think the main thing is, as I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve said, the status quo is simply unsustainable. It will be dealt with in one of two ways. Either Republicans will agree and change the status quo, or the markets will continue to collapse, and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll have to sit down with Senator Schumer. And my suspicion is that any negotiation with the Democrats would include none of the reforms that we would like to make, both on the market side and the Medicaid side. So for all of those reasons, we need to come up with a solution.The American people elected us to do that.‚Äù Follow Pam Key on Twitter
