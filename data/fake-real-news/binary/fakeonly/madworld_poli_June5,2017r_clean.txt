Former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s highly-anticipated return to network television kicked off over the weekend with her new show on NBC, Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly. However, it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exactly a resounding success. After being humiliated by Russian President Vladimir Putin last week in the Kremlin, Kelly returned stateside to even more terrible news. Despite all of the publicity surrounding her new show, the ratings were disappointing, to say the least. In fact, Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly lost to a rerun of 60 Minutes in total viewers. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right, Kelly‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s brand new gig, which was seemingly all that the mainstream media could talk about for months, lost to a rerun. Last month, Kelly said in an interview with TV Insider that her new show would not try to compete with 60 Minutes. ‚ÄoeThey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been doing it for 50 years, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a hugely rated show not just in news but in all of television,‚Äù she told the outlet. ‚ÄoeOur goal is not to beat 60 Minutes. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s to do great journalism in a way that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s compelling and dynamic,‚Äù added Kelly. ‚ÄoeOur show looks and feels a little different from what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been seen before. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll see some pieces that are a little more cutting edge and more irreverent.‚Äù If she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s looking to establish a reputation as being ‚Äoeirreverent,‚Äù Kelly certainly got the ball rolling in Russia, where critics likened her wardrobe choice for a sit-down interview with Vladimir Putin to that of a ‚Äoehigh-class hooker.‚Äù Kelly ‚Ä" the former Fox News star who departed for NBC in January ‚Ä" promoted a high-profile interview with Russian president Vladimir Putin to help kick off her Sunday night show. Critical reception to the interview was mixed, though the exchange between Kelly and Putin could be fairly described as contentious; when Kelly asked whether Putin might have compromising information on U.S. President Donald Trump, the Russian president asked: ‚ÄoeHave you all lost your senses over there?‚Äù [Source: Breitbart] It appears that NBC viewers have not taken to Kelly any kinder than Fox News viewers did during the election season. Indeed, the anchor let her true colors show when she began waging near-constant attacks on President Donald Trump for no apparent reason, systematically alienating her right-wing viewer base. Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly will run through the summer until NBC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Sunday Night Football premieres in September, at which point Kelly‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s show will return in February after the network ends its coverage of the Winter Olympics. Until then, Kelly will debut another show at NBC, a morning news program that will immediately follow the network‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s top-rated Today. Perhaps Kelly will have better luck with that endeavor, but I wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hold my breath if I were her.
