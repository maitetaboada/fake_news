The media has been relentless these days when it comes to bashing President Donald Trump as they hope it somehow leads to his impeachment. Unfortunately for the leftist propaganda networks, Trump used the time they spent trying to tarnish his reputation for something better ‚Ä" and what he quietly did behind their backs has left many people speechless. Between alleged Russian collusion and accusations about the mishandling of classified data, liberals have kept extremely busy when it comes to ousting the man they so desperately hate. Of course, seeing how they have absolutely no proof of either, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s an uphill battle, to say the least. Sadly, this reality has resulted in a shocking turn of events as the left has begun to lie, mislead, and deceive in order to help along their agenda. Too bad for them, it seems that as they were so consumed in their own efforts most recently that they missed what was actually going on in the Oval Office. As it turns out, Trump used the time that the media has been busy, focusing on his so-called impeachable practices, to do something worthwhile. In fact, recent reports indicate that Trump went to bat for an American pastor in hopes that he would be released from Turkish custody. President Trump spent much of his time in a White House meeting on Tuesday pressuring Turkey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s president to return an American pastor jailed on bogus charges in the country. ‚ÄoePresident Trump raised the incarceration of Pastor Andrew Brunson and asked that the Turkish Government expeditiously return him to the United States,‚Äù the White House said in a press release following Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s meeting with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Brunson, a North Carolina native, has been in jail in Turkey since October. [Source: Daily Caller] For those unaware, Brunson and his wife, Norine, were initially detained for ‚Äoevisa-related issues,‚Äù but things took a pretty serious turn. For reasons unknown, the pastor was held longer than his spouse with charges against him eventually evolving into a ‚Äoevague terrorism rap.‚Äù Brunson is accused of being a supporter of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric who the Turkish government claims is a terrorist. However, this doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really make sense as the pastor and his wife have lived in Turkey for 23 years, where they own and operate a small Christian church. Even more so pointing to the fact that this is a farce is the fact that Erdogan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s regime has arrested tens of thousands of people in Turkey based on questionable allegations of having ties to Gulen. Of course, 99.8% of the population in Turkey is Muslim ‚Ä" and the entire world knows how members of Islam treat Christians. Seeing the work Brunson was successfully doing in the area, it seems officials decided to put an end to it, resulting in an innocent man being wrongfully imprisoned in the name of Allah. The ACLJ outright states that Brunson was jailed specifically for his faith. Although there is no word on Erdogan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s response at this time, the fact that Trump was willing to go to bat for one man has a large portion of the country absolutely speechless. After all, we haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seen this kind of concern for at least the past 8 years, especially not toward a single Christian man. The fact of the matter here is that Trump is doing what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s best for this country despite what the media is trying to do to him. Every American is important ‚Ä" even those who previous leaders left to rot. The left can try to make President Trump out to be an awful, evil man all they want, but my guess is, they would be singing a different tune if Brunson was one of their family members or loved ones.
