While President Donald Trump was on his first foreign trip abroad, no one could miss Barack and Michelle Obama acting like fools, shadowing the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s every move. They tried to grab the headlines, running around Italy and Germany like they were still in charge. Well, Trump had enough of Barack‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s antics, so he just got sweet revenge on him. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to love this. In case you missed it, Barack Obama has been making a mockery out of himself all throughout Europe. He really pissed off patriots when he met with Angela Merkel, acting like an official representative of the United States. Making matters worse, Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s trip was step by step in sync with the European leg of President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s. The difference between the two men, Trump and Obama, was made evident by how they ended their trips. President Trump ended his nine-day trip with our troops at the Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily. Obama ended his shadow trip with British royalty, hobnobbing with Prince Harry. Actually, Obama looked pathetic. Obama couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get the Queen or Prince William or even Prince Charles to meet with him. No, all Obama could get was the fifth in line to the British crown, and why was that? The answer is even more embarrassing and goes to the heart of Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s continued arrogance and overplaying his role. You see, Obama is not the president anymore, and it seems the British crown refused to have Obama meet with anyone with real political importance. All poor Barry could get was the consolation prize, Prince Harry. There was no royal treatment for Obama in Britain, and it seems they couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait to get rid of him. All he got was a measly tweet, no official statement or press release about his visit. The Sun reports, ‚ÄoeKensington Palace tweeted: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Prince Harry hosted former US President Barack Obama at Kensington Palace today. They discussed support for veterans, mental health, conservation, empowering young people and the work of their respective founders.'‚Äù Prince Harry hosted former US President at Kensington Palace today. ‚Ä" Kensington Palace () May 27, 2017 There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no doubt Obama got ‚Äoetrumped‚Äù on his European trip. The only head of state that would meet with the former president was Germany‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Angela Merkel, the most hated woman in Europe for her pro-Muslim migrant policies. Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lackeys were working frantically to get him seen with official heads of state, so why did he get rejected? It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s simple, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just a private citizen with no real power. Not even the ninety-year-old Queen had time for him. If that wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bad enough, Trump got further revenge on Obama as he addressed the troops at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily, saying, ‚ÄoeI think we hit a home run no matter where we are, and now, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re getting on that very big plane and heading back to Washington. I can think of no better way to conclude our first foreign trip than to spend time with you [the troops], we will always support you. And we will never, ever forget you.‚Äù Trump is making it clear that he is the one who hits a home run, no matter where he is, that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s he and Melania who are getting on Air Force One, not Barry and Michelle. Lastly, he gives his respects to the troops, vowing to always support them, something that Obama failed to do during his presidency. Barack Obama needs to get a psyche evaluation. Never have we seen a former president jet around, following a sitting president, as he tries to meet with foreign heads of state. If this is part of Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s master plan to take out Trump, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s safe to say: Trump-1, Obama-0. Barack‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the thing that won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go away, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not only Americans who are sick and tired of his shenanigans. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s successful foreign trip was a major step in making America great again, and Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s trip failed big time in doing a damn thing about stopping that at all.
