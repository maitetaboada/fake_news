Former President Barack Obama made waves recently after he decided to attack President Donald Trump while publicly speaking with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Unfortunately for the woman who thought it would be a good idea to nod along, things took an embarrassing turn for her just a few hours later ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s when Trump dropped a damning admission while standing just feet away. Mad World News previously reported on Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s meddling as he stopped for a few words in Berlin, Germany. Of course, he was joined by Merkel, who was seen nodding along as the former president took a shot at Trump, saying, ‚ÄoeWe can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hide behind a wall.‚Äù Unfortunately for both of them, they weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t laughing just a short time later as Merkel arrived for an event at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. With several heads of state there, many expected the gathering to go off without a hitch, which it did ‚Ä" until President Trump decided to rightfully ruffle a few feathers after the ignorance spewed just hours before. According to Washington Free Beacon, President Trump used his time at the podium to rip into NATO members who were standing mere feet away ‚Ä" Merkel included. As can be heard in the video of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s speech, he told the world that these heads of state weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t meeting their defense obligations. ‚ÄoeThese grave security concerns are the same reason that I have been very, very direct with Secretary [Jens] Stoltenberg and members of the alliance in saying that NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄoeBut 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they are supposed to be paying for their defense. This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States.‚Äù Of course, the look on their faces said it all as utter embarrassment flushed over every one of their faces. As it turns out, being called out and ultimately humiliated isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t all that much fun ‚Ä" and it certainly showed. But, it was definitely deserved. Just look at the reaction of NATO members as Trump said directly to their faces that 23 out of 28 nations aren't contributing enough. ‚Ä" Steve Kopack () May 25, 2017 Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s remarks were actually an informal dig at Obama as well since the former president ultimately allowed fellow NATO members to abuse and rape U.S. taxpayers without saying a word. However, times are changing under new leadership, and if Trump made anything clear, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s that this irresponsible behavior is going to come to an end because we now have a president that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s putting the people he is supposed to serve first. The fact is, big government doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help anyone. First of all, it steals more money from its citizens, and then, on top of that, it turns around and spends said money in whatever way it wants. It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ask, and it certainly doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care how the people it took from feel about who it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s given away to. Our founding fathers would be disgusted to see how corrupt politicians have perverted their every word over the years ‚Ä" and rightfully so. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a disgrace. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s often said, ‚ÄoeFreedom isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t free,‚Äù and neither is security. Borrowing a line from the left, I think it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s high time that everyone starts paying their fair share. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know about you, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sick and tired of getting ripped off because someone else doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mind being a freeloader. Fortunately, we now have a world leader who not only isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t afraid to say it but can also enforce it as well.
