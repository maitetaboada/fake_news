First Lady Melania Trump recently decided to stop by a Florida children‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s home for a surprise visit. Unfortunately, things would take quite a turn after she walked in only to be attacked a short time later ‚Ä" but the worst part came as she learned the shocking reason for the assault. As Palm Beach Post reports, it all started when Melania took a little detour to HomeSafe, an organization that provides support to victims of abuse and domestic violence in Lake Worth. After giving a motivational speech to a group of young girls between the ages of 12 and 17, she gave each of them a gift basket, but things would soon take a turn for the worst. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m here to support you and help you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄoeI want to encourage you, and do whatever I can to help you achieve your dreams.‚Äù ‚ÄoeThis is a day that the girls will never forget,‚Äù Matthew Ladika, the chief executive officer of HomeSafe, told the Palm Beach Post. ‚ÄoeIt was extra special and touching ‚Ä¶ She asked them what their interests are,‚Äù Ladika added. [Source: Opposing Views] Although the visit got off to a good start, unfortunately, things were far from over. Little did Melania know, pictures taken during the event would result in liberal outrage for one shocking reason. As it turns out, the left decided to launch an all-out attack over her shoes. According to Footwear News, Melania decided to take a break from her go-to Christian Louboutin pumps and wore a pair of Rene Caovilla sandals. Of course, seeing how they retail for a whopping $1,150 at Nordstrom, well, entitled brats everywhere immediately threw a hissy fit. Unfortunately for the smug little morons who felt that way, they were quickly shut down by a few simple facts. For one, no one knows when she bought them ‚Ä" they could very easily out-date her position as First Lady. Secondly, this kind of money spent on shoes is exactly what Melania is used to spending as her life before the White House was luxurious, to say the least. Furthermore, the income her family enjoys came well before her husband took office, and the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s beloved Obamas can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t say the same. Not to mention, they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t whine this way about Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s $12,000 jacket ‚Ä" another Democrat who got rich while ‚Äoeserving‚Äù the country. So, it comes as little surprise that the worst ribbing was launched by your average Joe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s who simply wanted to tell the sniveling leftists to quit complaining over every little thing. ‚ÄoeAre you people so full of hate that you have to nitpick about everything they do?‚Äù one social media user asked. ‚ÄoeAt least she is trying to bring some happiness to some kids who have nothing‚Ä¶ get over yourselves and appreciate that she is there‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄoeYou guys are really low to attack her for this,‚Äù another commenter wrote. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not a huge Trump fan and you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to like him or their family‚Ä¶that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fine, but when she does something nice, why do you have to be jerks about it.‚Äù The fact of the matter here is that this nation is so far in the hole because of liberal policy that the shoes on Melania‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s feet should be the last concern of anyone. We need to get this nation back on track, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not going to happen if everyone isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t all in. Sadly, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re seeing that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the case as they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll oppose President Donald Trump and even every member of his family for the mere sake of spite and argument, even though it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s extremely hypocritical. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for the left to grow up before they find Melania kicking a little butt of her own. I mean, regardless of how expensive those shoes may be, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not going to hurt any less when they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re lodged up a liberal butt. And, most of us wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t blame her one bit.
