Christine Braswell, 26, said the man, later identified as Robert Raines, was rummaging through her SUV in the Walmart parking lot. Braswell took off on foot after the man, but decided to hop in her car to chase him down because she is five months pregnant. ‚ÄoeHe was with my purse and he took off and I took off after him,‚Äù Braswell told WLOS. ‚ÄoeMe being five months pregnant, I chased a little ways then come back, jumped in the car, threw it in gear and come across the curb and ran him over. I was not going to let him get away with it. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not right, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not fair.‚Äù Braswell was caught on camera hitting Raines with her car in the parking lot.
