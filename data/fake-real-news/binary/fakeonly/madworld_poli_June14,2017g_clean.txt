Before a famous monk passed away 500 years ago, he penned a letter to the West warning of a mass migration that is happening today. However, what he prophesies will happen almost 5 centuries after his death is too chilling to deny. Those who understand the violent and oppressive fundamentals of Islam and its murderous history have served as harbingers of what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s to come if non-Muslim nations appease Muslims. Unfortunately, centuries after the Crusades thwarted the bloody conquest of Europe by the Ottoman Empire, the left hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t learned from history and has doomed us to repeat it. In fact, one revolutionary monk identified this cycle in the 16th century and wrote a series of works in an effort to prevent its reemergence. Martin Luther is best known for nailing 95 debate questions on the door of Wittenburg Church on October 31, 1517. However, when this Augustinian monk wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t spurring the Protestant Reformation, he was sounding the righteous alarm on the world‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s most dangerous ideology ‚Ä" Islam. After being made an outlaw by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V for his controversial calls for reformation, Luther spent time in exile in Germany penning a blunt warning to both Christians and all non-Muslims alike. While Muslim Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent was invading Austria with 100,000 Turks surrounding Vienna in 1529, Luther wrote a prediction that still holds true nearly 500 years later. ‚ÄoeThe Turk is the rod of the wrath of the Lord our God. ‚Ä¶ If the Turk‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s god, the devil, is not beaten first, there is reason to fear that the Turk will not be so easy to beat. ‚Ä¶ Christian weapons and power must do it‚Ä¶‚Äù In addition to exposing the root of the problem as the religion of the Turks, Luther included a plan to defeat any Muslim invasion. The monk called out the liberal opposition to Christianity for paving the road for Islamization in every Western country no matter how powerful it is. ‚Äoe(The fight against the Turks) must begin with repentance, and we must reform our lives, or we shall fight in vain. (The Church should) drive men to repentance by showing our great and numberless sins and our ingratitude, by which we have earned God‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wrath and disfavor, so that He justly gives us into the hands of the devil and the Turk.‚Äù Luther wrote these words calling out certain Protestants who refused to fight against the Muslim Turks. Instead, they sought a peaceful approach, much like the passive appeasement of Muslims by the political left today. Had Charles V not refuted this tactic and chosen to combat Islam both militantly and ideologically, Europe, and perhaps the world, would be ruled by Sharia law. Luther concluded that the education system would be the deciding factor if the West would uphold freedom or fall to Islamic oppression. By the way that he wrote about the school systems, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s almost as if he knew that the Islamization of education would enable Sharia law. Luther‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s warning has already been proven in the UK with the ongoing Trojan Horse scandal in which Muslims have infiltrated schools to push Islamic indoctrination. ‚ÄoeI am much afraid that schools will prove to be the great gates of hell unless they diligently labor in explaining the Holy Scriptures, engraving them in the hearts of youth.‚Äù These Protestant dissenters are eerily similar to today‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s liberals in that they protested against Charles V‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s retaliation against the invading Turks. Hundreds of millions would go on to die during the Muslim conquests. In fact, at the very least estimate, 270 million non-Muslims have been ruthlessly slaughtered by Muslims since the war campaign of the prophet Muhammad until now. Luther‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s letter is incredibly accurate today as Europe has once again been infiltrated by Muslim invaders. However, this time, the intruders are wielding the weapon of political correctness instead of the sword of their ancestors. While Luther‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sinister prediction has already begun, his alarm proves that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not too late to eradicate the threat of Islamization. Luther teaches that it is the responsibility of the West to reintroduce those Christian-based values that have secured our liberties and progress. Our Founding Fathers established the U.S. on these same beliefs, and the Christian majority has ensured its success in becoming the most prosperous nation on earth. However, just as Luther warned, once we abandon these values for the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s appeasement of Islam, we will become its slaves.
