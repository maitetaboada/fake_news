Democrat Mark Warner, one of the richest members of the Senate, is a Russia conspiracy theorist who hates President Donald Trump. However, his wild accusations have boomeranged on him now that the truth is coming out on how he got his wealth. The Gateway Pundit reports that Warner is in no position to point fingers at President Donald Trump over alleged ties to Russia. Back in 2012, Warner earned $6 million from Russian search engine and technology company, Yandex. Got News also reported on Warner‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hypocrisy: As far as we know, President Donald J. Trump has made 0% of his net worth from Russian companies. Maybe Warner should investigate his own ties to Russia. Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner, the ranking member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, is blocking the White House from appointing a Treasury Department official to oversee financial crimes committed by terrorists. Warner, worth over $80 million, is one of the Senate‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s richest members. Warner wants to examine documents on a number of Trump advisers in order to determine if any of them profited from a relationship with Russia. Recently, he commented, ‚Äoe[U]ntil we get [their documents], I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not going to support the administration‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nominee for undersecretary of Treasury finance, for terrorism and finance, because they owe us these documents first.‚Äù Warner‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s financial disclosure documents on Scribd show his own involvement with Russia: The Christian Science Monitor also commented on Warner‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s net worth, saying it is $85.81 million in 2012. It adds, ‚ÄoeHe also has stock in the Russian search engine Yandex worth at least $6.75 million.‚Äù It is no wonder that Warner is pushing the Trump/Russia collusion narrative. It is an age-old trick in politics: accuse your opponent of doing the very things that you are guilty of yourself. So far, not a shred of credible evidence has emerged that ties Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s victory over Hillary Clinton to Russia in any way. Democrats are sore losers, who represent a losing platform that continues to plummet in popularity, so they rely on lies and false narratives in an attempt to cling to power. It is a new era, however; one that finds an American electorate sick and tired of business as usual. Americans prefer authenticity, and President Donald Trump has it, while liberals like Mark Warner do not.
