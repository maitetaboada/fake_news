The New York-based International Rescue Committee (IRC) sent out an email asking for donations which began: ‚ÄoeThe Supreme Court has reinstated parts of President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s misguided travel ban and the impact on refugee families is immediate and devastating.‚Äù The website for IRC says: The United States has a long tradition of offering refuge to those fleeing persecution and war. However, the Trump Administration, citing unfounded security concerns, has moved to suspend the refugee resettlement program for 120 days and slash refugee arrivals in 2017 by more than half. The IRC says people should get involved and donate because: The Church World Service (CWS) another ‚ÄoeVoluntary Agency‚Äù listed by the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement, issued a statement after the Supreme Court‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s opinion was released Monday saying: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Enabling any variation of President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s discriminatory refugee and Muslim ban to go into effect-even temporarily-is an imprudent, devastating blow to our fundamental values of justice and humanity. We will continue to use all measures at our disposal to fully rescind this un-American ban and urge our elected officials to exercise political courage in the face of this legal and humanitarian setback.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Together, our spirit will never yield to such exclusionary policies.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> After this statement, CWS includes a link to GreaterAs1.org which asks for a donation. The organization also tweeted the following which included a link to their GreaterAs1.org donation page. The #SCOTUS decision today does not reflect our nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s proud legacy of welcome, nor the strong support for refugees. #GreaterAs1 ‚Ä" CWS () June 26, 2017 CWS has also issued a statement urging people to ‚ÄoeTell the White House & Congress that you OPPOSE Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Announcement to Grind Refugee Resettlement To a Halt & Bar Refugees from Certain Countries.‚Äù It includes the phone numbers to call ‚ÄoePresident Trump‚Äù and ‚ÄoeYour Senators and Representatives‚Äù and a script on what to say, including: ‚ÄoeI am strongly opposed to President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s announcements to stop the resettlement of refugees from Syria, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.‚Äù The Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service (LIRS) did not directly ask for money, but it emailed out a script and asked people to ‚ÄoeTell Congress and the [Trump] Administration to conduct the review of the refugee admission process in good faith and as quickly as possible, and resettle at least 75,000 refugees during Fiscal Year 2018.‚Äù The statement was entitled, ‚ÄoeAdvocate for 75,000 Refugees.‚Äù The organization said the Supreme Court decision would ‚Äoeseverely affect‚Äù their ‚Äoeability to conduct the lifesaving work of providing safety and protection for the most vulnerable refugees, regardless of their nationality or religion.‚Äù There was a ‚ÄoeGIVE TODAY‚Äù link on the email.
