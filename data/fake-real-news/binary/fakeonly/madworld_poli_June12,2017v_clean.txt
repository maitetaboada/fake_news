A Trump-hating Florida high school principal is in hot water after what he did to a senior who fairly won the election for class president with an epic Trump-like speech. Unfortunately, the high schooler‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s principal decided to make the boy pay for his words. After exercising his liberal agenda and crushing this kid‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right to free speech, the activist principal is about to face some consequences that he never saw coming. According to WPTV5, JP Krauss, a senior at Vero Beach High School in Vero Beach, Florida, was filmed giving a Trump-like campaign speech for senior class president in April 2017. The following day, Krauss won the election, but his victory was short-lived as he was disqualified and given a detention for his ‚Äoeoffensive‚Äù speech. Now, Principal Shawn O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Keefe and the school district are in hot water for the way they treated Krauss. Watch as Krauss delivers the speech that earned him a detention and disqualification from the school‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s election after the liberal principal invalidated his votes. What‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s truly shocking about the punishment from the liberal school administration is that at no time did Krauss use explicit language or suggest any kind of questionable behavior from the student body. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d like to thank you all for coming here today. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d just like to say that I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m hoping I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be able to win your vote with free speech,‚Äù Krauss began. ‚ÄoeI represent every student my opponent does not. I am all for freedom, equality, and liberty. My opponent wants to advance communist ideas into the very fabric of our government. She will expand the government so that you will not be able to do anything. She will likely create a dress-code for you all.‚Äù The teacher interjected, ‚ÄoeJP, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m already doing that.‚Äù The students laughed as Krauss continued. ‚ÄoeShe will raise taxes to 80 percent. I do not want any taxes for our students. Our student body is the most, is one of the smartest in our county,‚Äù Krauss said, according to FOX News. Speaking about his opponent again, Krauss said, ‚ÄoeShe wants, she represents Sebastian River High School. What I want, what I propose is that we build a wall between here and Sebastian River and we make Sebastian River pay for it.‚Äù The class broke into laughter as the fed-up liberal teacher cut into Krauss‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> speech again, asking, ‚ÄoeAre you done?‚Äù Krauss gave his closing remarks, saying, ‚ÄoeThank you all, and I hope I win your vote tomorrow.‚Äù By this point, it was clear that the teacher in the class was irritated with Krauss and wanted him to stop talking. The following day, Krauss won the election and celebrated the victory for only a moment before the principal decided that the election results should be nullified and Krauss should be punished with a detention for ‚Äoeharassment.‚Äù This is the sad state of affairs in our public school system. Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face it, free speech is only allowed in public schools as long as it is liberal free speech. Too often, conservative students who want their voices heard are persecuted and disciplined for exercising their right to free speech. Although Krauss‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> speech and the election took place in April, the consequences for the principal and the school district are just beginning. The Krauss family was shocked when JP was punished for exercising his free speech in a school election, and Angela Krauss, JP‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mom, said she wishes the situation was handled better and expressed her concern over his disciplinary record affecting college applications and career. This not an unreasonable concern for Krauss‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> mother to have. The majority of American colleges and universities have reached toxic levels of liberal fanaticism in their admission practices. Add in the fact that Krauss appears to be white and isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a brainwashed progressive and his chances of getting into college shrink considerably. ‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think there was anything wrong,‚Äù Angela explained. ‚ÄoeHe was being silly. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 17!‚Äù Now, the disciplinary incident has caught the attention of the non-profit Pacific Legal Foundation, which reached out to the family. Reportedly, they are providing the family legal counsel free of charge. Pacific Legal Foundation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Senior Attorney Mark Miller sent a letter to the Indian River County School District, asking them to reconsider their illegal behavior and declare JP as class president. In addition, the letter asks that the harassment claims be removed from JP‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s school record. ‚ÄoeWhat JP was doing was engaged in the most basic first amendment protected speech, which is pure political speech,‚Äù Miller says. ‚ÄoeWhat they did was violate his constitutional rights.‚Äù I could not agree more with Miller. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for liberals to stop attacking conservative students in our high schools and colleges. The school district has not yet responded to requests for comment, but as the story spreads, so will the outrage over the school‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ridiculous decision, which will eventually force them to address the issue. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to raise our voices for JP and make sure everyone hears what happened to him.
