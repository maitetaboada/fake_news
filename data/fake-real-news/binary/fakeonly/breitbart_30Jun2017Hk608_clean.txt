‚ÄoeThank you for letting us into your country,‚Äù U2 frontman Bono told the sold-out crowd Wednesday night at MetLife Stadium, reports the New York Daily News, in a somewhat subtle swipe at the Trump administration‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s newly-enacted travel ban. Wednesday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s set was the first of two New Jersey-based stops on the North American leg of the ‚ÄoeThe Joshua Tree Tour.‚Äù Later in the night, the band played a video of a girl from Syria.

It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a civil country. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the land of dreams.‚Äù On Thursday, Bono doubled down and told the packed audience that America remains a country of immigrants. ‚ÄoeThis city, this country has given us Irish safety and sanctuary for hundreds of years,‚Äù Bono said. ‚ÄoeWe would like to say thank you.‚Äù While President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s name was never mentioned, the show‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tone appeared to reflect the Supreme Court‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s decision this week to allow the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s travel ban to be implemented, after it had been rejected several times by lower courts. Bono also urged members of the American media to remain ‚Äoevigilant.‚Äù Singer Bono of the band U2 performs during U2 ‚ÄoeJoshua Tree Tour 2017‚Äù at MetLife Stadium on June 28, 2017 in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

U2‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s last U.S. show on the ‚ÄoeThe Joshua Tree Tour‚Äù is scheduled for Saturday in Cleveland, with more dates scheduled in Europe later this summer. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter
