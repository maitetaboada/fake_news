On Tuesday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚ÄoeRachel Maddow Show,‚Äù Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) stated that the Senate GOP healthcare bill had a ‚Äoesinister cravenness‚Äù and is ‚Äoean injustice‚Äù that people must fight against because evil triumphs when good people do nothing. While discussing protests and rallies against the Senate bill, Booker said, ‚ÄoeThere‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s an old saying that you know, the only thing necessary for evil to be triumphant is for good people to do nothing. There is a sinister cravenness in this bill. It is really a moral moment for this country about who will we stand for, the rich and the powerful, or the health care of all of us, whether it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s seniors in nursing homes, children being born, people with disabilities. This is a moral moment, and we can let a bill that is truly a[n] an injustice reign in our country or we can do something about it.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄoeFor people to sit on the sidelines in this defining moment in American history, for people to sit back and hope somebody else stops this, or wait on their senator to make the right decision, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s never how great moments like this have been crafted in this country. It has been grassroots activists demanding change, fighting against evil, standing up. And now, more than ever, we need Americans to understand that democracy is not a spectator sport. You have got to get into this fight, and you now have an extension of two more weeks of fighting, two more weeks of protesting, two more weeks of getting folk woke so that they, too, get into the game. And let folk ‚Ä" let every senator know, Democrat or Republican, that there will be consequences if you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fall on the right side of this, or you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fall with the people.‚Äù Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter
