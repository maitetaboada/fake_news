Welfare leeches in Alabama were hit with some bad news when the state placed a new requirement on one of their favorite freebies. As it turns out, food stamp recipients aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t very happy about the change, which had one immediate result that no one saw coming. Former President Barack Obama was a conniving man. Everything he did was very meticulously planned to either benefit himself or his party. That was proven during the last recession as he lifted the work requirements on welfare that forced people to show that they were looking for work in order to receive the benefits. In turn, several states followed suit, like Alabama, which removed the requirement for recipients to be employed in order to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) assistance. Although it stayed like that for awhile, things have most recently taken a turn with President Donald Trump now in office. According to The Blaze, the state of Alabama has once again placed the work requirement on food stamps. However, something immediately happened that no one really saw coming ‚Ä" at least not to the degree that it did. Although officials expected the number of recipients to drop a little bit, in the 13 counties where the rule was implemented, the number of food stamp users fell by a staggering 85%. As of Jan. 1, 2017, there were 13,663 able-bodied adults without dependents receiving food stamps statewide. That number dropped to 7,483 by May 1, 2017. Among the 13 counties, there were 5,538 adults ages 18-50 without dependents receiving food stamps as of Jan. 1, 2017. That number dropped to 831 ‚Ä" a decline of about 85 percent ‚Ä" by May 1, 2017. [Source: AL.com] In short, this means that there were about 5,000 freeloaders in just those 13 counties who were leeching off the American taxpayer and didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t need to be. However, that number becomes even more shocking when you look at that on a national scale. With there being 3,007 counties across America and SNAP benefits costing American taxpayers $71 billion annually, well, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not hard to see where this is going. Applying this 85% rate of fraudulent food stamps users and it means freeloaders soaking up an undeserved $60 billion per year. As we all know, President Trump has promised to cut the food stamp budget by $2 billion a year, and Democrats have lost their mind over the matter. Of course, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a very good reason for that as they know constituents will vote blue to keep the handouts coming. With those now coming to a screeching halt, well, no wonder they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re panicking. The voters they have enslaved to the government through ‚Äoebenefits‚Äù are being forced to get a job, and by the time the vote rolls around again, these constituents might just learn that they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like being under the thumb of their Democrat masters. Seeing how there seems to be a lot more waste than just the $2 billion proposed cut, can you imagine if Trump successfully decreases spending by $20 billion or even up to $60 billion? Just think about the tax relief that could provide Americans. Too long have the lazy been able to take advantage of hardworking Americans. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time we keep the money in the pockets of those who actually earn it. We aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a socialist country. That style of government has never worked, just ask Venezuelans. If you want something, you better be willing to get out there and work for it like the rest of us. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s how we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to make America great again.
