On Friday, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) spoke at the Personal Democracy Forum at New York University, where she delivered a profanity-laced rant targeted at President Donald Trump. Unfortunately for Gillibrand, though, her unsavory tirade was captured on video, and it will surely haunt her for years to come. A massive backlash has ensued for the senator who should have just kept her big mouth shut. ‚ÄoeHas [President Donald Trump] kept any of these promises? No. Fuck no,‚Äù said Senator Gellibrand at Friday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s forum. ‚ÄoeSorry, I understand this is a younger audience. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s okay.‚Äù Actually, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not ‚Äoeokay‚Äù to hurl profane insults at a sitting U.S. president, especially when you hold an influential elected position like U.S. senator. How can the American people expect Gillibrand to work with Trump for their best interests when she can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even go two seconds without dropping the f-bomb? Her gratuitous bad language didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop there, though. Later in the interview, Gillibrand recycled a line from her New York Magazine interview in April, saying if Democrats aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t helping people, ‚Äoewe should go the fuck home.‚Äù Then, the moderator asked her about Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s infamous ‚Äoecovfefe‚Äù tweet, to which she replied, ‚ÄoeI think it was ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>coverage‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and he was bitching about the media and he just forgot to finish,‚Äù according to the Washington Free Beacon. Gillibrand‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s excessive profanity became so out of hand that the moderator was forced to speak up and drop a major hint that she should watch her mouth. ‚Äoe‚Ä¶my 90-year-old mom is sitting in the front row,‚Äù he told the Senator. ‚ÄoeOh God bless you, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sorry,‚Äù Gillibrand said, covering her face with her papers. Twitter users came out in force to voice their disgust over Gillibrand‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s potty mouth. The Gillibrand quotes suggest we are 85% of the way to Idiocracy. ‚Ä" John Podhoretz () June 9, 2017 Kirsten Gillibrand: Make The Word 'Fuck' Great Again 2020 ‚Ä" DORSEY () June 9, 2017 I'm convinced Gillibrand's approach to courting the Bernie left without actually adopting Bernie left positions is to just say fuck a lot ‚Ä" Andrei Berman () June 9, 2017 i don't give a shit about cursing but i think there are better ways for Gillibrand, Perez etc to appeal to young voters. u ‚Ä" Alex Kotch () June 9, 2017 The Democrats appear to be having a rough end to their week. Reports also surfaced on Friday of an embarrassing flub made by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at her morning press conference. In what has become a bit of a reoccurring theme for the California Congresswoman, she accidentally referred to President Donald Trump as President George W. Bush while in the midst of slamming the current Commander-in-Chief. At this point, I think it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s safe to say that the left needs to get it together. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no wonder Republicans took the House, the Senate, AND the presidency in the last election when you consider what a bunch of bumbling buffoons the Democrats have become.
