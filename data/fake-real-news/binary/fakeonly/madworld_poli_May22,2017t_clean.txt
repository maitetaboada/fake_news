President Trump and the First Lady made one of their first stops in Israel at one of the holiest sites, and immediately, the liberals and anti-Semites began to freak out. No other sitting president has ever gone to this ‚Äoecontroversial‚Äù location, and Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s very touching moment there proves that he stands strong with Israel and cares nothing about political correctness. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. President Trump and Melania made their way to the ‚ÄoeWestern Wall,‚Äù which is the only visible remains of King Soloman‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s temple. Jews see this site as one of the holiest locations, and no other president has ever dared to go there. Why? The Western Wall is in the West Bank, which is considered a ‚Äoedisputed‚Äù stretch of real estate that the Palestinians consider to be theirs. So, where other presidents decided it was too controversial, Trump decided to be bold, but that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not all. As CNN reports, on Monday, when President Trump became the first sitting US president to visit the Western Wall, one of the holiest sites in Judaism, he ‚Äoeplaced his right hand on the wall and swayed slightly back and forth with his eyes closed for nearly a minute,‚Äù all while wearing a yarmulke. Liberals waited to see if he would do what they did not want him to do, place a prayer within the wall, thereby showing the world he is a man of prayer and that he stands with the Jews. As CNN adds, ‚ÄoeHe then reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a noted on a folded piece of paper, and placed it into a crack in the wall.‚Äù The moment was profound. You could sense that this was a very solemn experience for President Trump. This went beyond politics for him; he was genuinely moved by the gravity and holiness of the moment. Watch Trump become the first sitting US president to visit The Western Wall #TrumpInIsrael ‚Ä" Business Insider () May 22, 2017 Immediately, liberals who hate Jews and support the Palestinians taking over all of Israel started spewing their venom. One commenter on social media wrote, ‚ÄoeBecause none of the others [presidents] were disrespectful enough to use this site as a photo op.‚Äù However, this would only be ‚Äoedisrespectful‚Äù to anti-Semites who believe that Israel has no business being a country in the Middle East. The real reason other presidents didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go to the Western Wall is that they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have the guts; they were taking the easy way out, politically. Others were pissed off because Trump was wearing a yarmulke, saying he shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wear that because he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not Jewish. ‚ÄoeHe isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even Jewish, and he can wear that Yamaka [sic],‚Äù wrote another commenter on Twitter. I guess they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand doing something out of respect for the holy site of another faith. Most Americans were touched by what Trump did at the Western Wall. They understand the risks he is taking by going on this trip and appreciate that he is representing our country with dignity, something we haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seen in a very long time. America is regaining respect in the world. Gone are the days of apologizing and backing Iran; we have a president who is not afraid to pray to God at the one site hated by terrorists across the world.
