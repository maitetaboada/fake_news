A couple weeks ago, I wrote a post about Huma Abedin filing for divorce. She had finally chopped off Anthony Weiner, or so the story went. This, despite the fact that reports had recently stated that the relationship was on the mend. Of course, the day she filed for divorce was also the day Weiner pled guilty to transferring obscene material to a minor, so maybe it was all about public perception. If so, perhaps she should have been smart enough to stay the fuck away from the guy. After all, the paparazzi has him and her staked out 24/7, 365. As it turns out, sheâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not that smart. Or maybe she has some kind of sickness herself? Ah, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s all about the child, you see! I think a lot of people might think it a bad idea to let this man have continued access to children, even those who are his own. He did take one of his crotch shots while his kid was laid up in the bed next to him. I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t think of too many things more disrespectful to a marriage than that. At least keep you kid of of your extramarital activities. Then again, Weiner has no shame and appears to be mentally ill. Which makes Humaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s choice all the more baffling. We all know Hillary Clintonâ€<sup>TM</sup>s prospects are in the dump, so itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not like Ms. Abedin is likely to return to frontline politics anytime soon. But she definitely wonâ€<sup>TM</sup>t be returning so long as the Weiner albatross is hanging around her neck. I think she might be just as deranged as he is. If he is indeed sick, let him get help, serve his time, and perhaps he could see the kid someday down the road. Way down the road. What kind of maniac letâ€<sup>TM</sup>s this disturbed individual continue to cohabitate with their child? Never mind. I think I answered my own question. 20
