Alex Jones just released a secret 30-minute audio recording of Megyn Kelly, which is going viral. Kelly is under a cloud of controversy from the mainstream media for interviewing Jones, but now she is facing more backlash after Jones secretly recorded and released every word Kelly said to him, and it is so damning that she may just lose her job. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t miss her complete downfall, all caught on audio for all the world to hear. On Thursday night, Alex Jones released the audio of his entire interview with Megyn Kelly, saying he secretly recorded the controversial sit-down because he ‚Äoeknew it was all crap.‚Äù The Infowars host posted a video online, along with a teaser clip, around 8:45 p.m. and claimed he would be posting the full tape on his website later in the evening. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve never done this in 22 years, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve never recorded another journalist, but I knew it was a fraud, that it was a lie,‚Äù Jones said in the video, recalling how Kelly approached him about the interview. ‚ÄoeGod, she was like, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I want to get steaks with you, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m obsessed with you, oh my God,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> wiggling around in her seat. It was all crap,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄoeI knew it was all a lie. I said Sandy Hook happened, and she wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even put it in the promo pieces.‚Äù Kelly‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s phone call to Jones to try to convince him to do the interview was taped too. Her voice was super sugary sweet, and she did say she admired Jones for the custody battle he had just gone through with his kids. Jones was reluctant to do the interview, so Kelly can be heard on the recorded audio saying, ‚ÄoeAll I can do is give you my word and I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t double-cross. My goal is for your listeners and the left ‚Ä" you know, who will be watching some on NBC ‚Ä" to say, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Wow, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really interesting.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>‚Äù She even added, ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not going to be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that.‚Äù Jones proves that Kelly and NBC heavily edited the interview to make it look like Jones believed the Sandy Hook massacre never happened. Jones admits he looked ‚Äoeat it from all sides,‚Äù which suggests he did give airtime to those nutjobs who thought that no kids were actually killed. The bottom line is Jones outsmarted ole‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Megyn and all of NBC. Jones has now scooped Kelly with this audio, and this is only part one. He has an additional video coming out on Sunday to contradict the piece NBC will air. I can't stand . She thinks she's so clever and wise. She got outfoxed by Alex Jones. LOL, I hope she develops some humility. ‚Ä" Shawn Beaton () June 16, 2017 But, we have to understand who Megyn was really out to get, and that was President Donald Trump. It seems Kelly is still holding a grudge against the president. She wanted to show Jones as a lunatic and as a right wing fanatic because she says Trump listens to Alex Jones and the American people need to see who their president talks to. POTUS's been on & praises ' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light. ‚Ä" Megyn Kelly () June 12, 2017 She claims Infowars was granted White House press credentials when they were only given a day pass. Kelly was just out to use Jones to get back at Donald Trump, and it backfired big time. ‚ÄoeThe outlet [InfoWars] was reportedly granted only day-long press credentials, which are far easier to receive and viewed as less prestigious than a permanent pass,‚Äù reported Business Insider. ‚ÄoeJones, who has since admitted that the Sandy Hook shooting was real, said in his preview video on Thursday that Kelly and NBC took his words out of context and edited his interview to make it seem like he still was on the fence about the subject,‚Äù reported Page Six. Megyn Kelly didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t count on Alex Jones outsmarting both her and the media gods at NBC. They are looking like a bunch of idiots today, and for that, we are very grateful. Thankfully, Kelly wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t able to tarnish President Trump either. Holding a grudge against Trump and trying to use NBC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s platform to make others hate Trump is sick, so here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hoping Megyn Kelly gets fired over this. She just exposed NBC for what it is, a number one fake news outlet, pushing their own political agenda, truth be damned.
