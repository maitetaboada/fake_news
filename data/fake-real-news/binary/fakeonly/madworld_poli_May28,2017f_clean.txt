Millie Fontana, 24, was raised by two women. Her father was a friend of one of her mothers from high school, and they naturally conceived her and her two brothers. After growing up with lesbian mothers, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s speaking out to shed light on the negative effects of depriving a child of a mother and a father, and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s infuriating liberals in the process. ‚ÄoeThis is my main issue with the gay community right now,‚Äù Fontana said during Wednesday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s episode of the ABC series You Can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t Ask That. ‚ÄoeThese people that think they have a right to decide which parents the children have access to.‚Äù According to Daily Mail, Millie met her father when she was 11 years old, saying in previous interviews it was the first time she felt ‚Äoestable‚Äù in her adolescence. ‚Äoe[My father] was open to a relationship with us if that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s something that rose up in the future,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄoeBut it was strongly insinuated that we were fatherless,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄoeWhen I was a young kid, I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really want to bring people into my world,‚Äù Fontana recalled. ‚ÄoeHaving that understanding of who my father was would have benefited me to go into things like school‚Ä¶more confidently.‚Äù The way that her two mothers deprived Fontana of a father figure, even though her biological dad was open to having a relationship with her all along, caused the young girl to ‚Äoecling‚Äù to men in other families to a degree that was unhealthy. ‚ÄoeI would spend an almost unhealthy amount of time at their houses because I was fascinated by the heterosexual family structure,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄoeI couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t replace my actual father. It was still obvious to me there was quite a lot missing,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄoeI think a lot of parents in the same-sex community, one of them will try to masculinize themselves a little bit to make up for the lack of a father role,‚Äù Fontana claimed. This, though, was sorely ineffective at providing her with a male role model who could ‚Äoedo dad things with their kids.‚Äù There is a reason it requires a woman and a man to conceive a child, and it isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t obscure. Children need both a mother and a father to feel secure and grow into emotionally healthy adults. Even individuals who were raised by same-sex parents are now speaking out to say as much, and who would know better than them? Still, their voices are largely ignored by those on the left, because it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fit their narrative that everything gay is good. On the contrary, raising a child with two parents of the same gender has been likened to abuse, as it puts the child in such an uncomfortable position. In Millie Fontana‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s case especially, being that her father was always there waiting to have a relationship with her, the actions of her mothers are sorely reprehensible. They should be ashamed for allowing an agenda to take precedence over the well-being of a young girl who they supposedly loved.
