Former President Barack Obama traveled in style to Milan, Italy, staying in ritzy hotels and enjoying the glamorous life of a liberal celebrity. However, after one massive blunder in his highly-paid speech, people have reason to question his entire legacy, and many are even mocking it. Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s appearance at the Seeds & Chips ‚Ä" Global Food Innovation Summit was meant to address ‚Äoefood issues‚Äù and how climate change supposedly affects the world. Most of his speech followed predictable liberal talking points, but one particular assertion is so outrageously laughable that people couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help but take issue with it. ‚ÄoeThe mark of a good leader is somebody who is able to empower other people,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄoeSo often we think of leadership as somebody at the top who is ordering other people around ‚Ä¶ but it turns out, for me at least, what made me understand leadership was when I could see somebody who thought they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have a voice, thought they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have influence or didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have power, and teach them how to speak up on the things that were affecting their lives.‚Äù The Gateway Pundit was quick to point out that the Tea Party Movement was formed for that exact reason. Thanks to Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s divisive, misleading, and power-hungry leadership, millions of Americans joined together, many of them forming the Tea Party because he and his minions ignored their ‚Äoevoice.‚Äù Under Barack Obama, Democrats lost over 1,000 seats in Congress, the Senate, governorships, and state legislatures. No doubt, Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s leadership empowered people, but it was not Democrats or those who share in his leftist agenda as he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d have you believe. Surprisingly, Barack Obama made only a brief mention of his successor, President Donald Trump. Obama referred to Trump by name only once, discussing efforts to roll back on Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own ‚Äoeaggressive standards‚Äù on fuel efficiency for passenger cars. ‚ÄoeThe Trump administrative made a change,‚Äù Obama said, but he added that those moves would be up against even stricter standards in California, the country‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s largest car market. ‚ÄoeSo even if the rules change in Washington, there is not a U.S. automaker that can afford to produce a car that is not fuel efficient enough to be sold in California,‚Äù Obama said. [Source: U.S. News] In another questionable comment, Obama said that some refugees have flowed into Europe because of food shortages. He went on to say that climate change will contribute to continued food shortages, which will contribute to the influx of more refugees. Perhaps Al Gore would buy that one, but I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. It sounds like he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only using fear-mongering to get his way. Refugees aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t flooding Western nations for food. They are doing what Muslims have done for 1,400 years and invading foreign lands to continue their Islamization of the West and bring about the worldwide Islamic Caliphate, where all is for Allah, as their Quran commands. Now that Obama has returned from vacation to reenter public life, we are starting to get a sense of what the rest of his ‚Äoecareer‚Äù is going to be about. He will travel the globe, live the high life, and charge large amounts of money to make speeches that address liberal narratives. Between Chicago, California, New York, and most of Europe, there are enough wealthy left-wing organizations out there to keep him busy for a long time. As frustrating as that is, it is far better than having him in our White House. In fact, it will likely give us plenty to make fun of, but more importantly, he will spew the leftist ignorance publicly, giving us all a chance to correct his misinformation, just as we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve done here.
