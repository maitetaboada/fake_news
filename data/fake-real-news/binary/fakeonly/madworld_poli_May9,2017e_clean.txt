Barack Obama is back to his jet-setting lifestyle, this time in Italy, where he is promoting his pro-Islam, pro-globalist views. However, the Italians have an anti-Muslim-migrant, anti-globalist faction which won a great victory last year, kicking out their socialist prime minister, who held the same beliefs as Obama. When he landed in Italy, ready to preach his globalist message, Muslim migrants immediately had a nasty surprise for Barack. Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in Milan, Italy, to give a keynote speech on climate change at ‚ÄoeSeeds and Chips ‚Ä" The Global Food Innovation Summit.‚Äù Obama was greeted by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, a big socialist who is mounting a comeback after resigning when his referendum on constitutional reforms failed. Renzi welcomed Obama in a Facebook post, calling him ‚Äoea friend and great leader ‚Ä¶ who still has much to say and give to world politics.‚Äù Renzi was defeated by the Italian conservative party, and the main reason is that Italians are fed up with their beautiful country being overrun by Muslim migrants. Jihad Watch reports how protests began in 2016, saying, ‚ÄoeThe latest show of opposition comes after mafia bosses allegedly ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>declared war‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> on migrants after a man was shot in the head as a deadly turf war broke out with African crime gangs in Palermo earlier this year.‚Äù This event sparked the referendum which voted Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pal Renzi out, and the conservative movement in Italy is similar to the Donald Trump movement in the United States. The people just want their country back and are tired of these socialist-globalists, who have been in charge, allowing millions of Muslim migrants to cross into their borders. So, Obama traveled to Italy as this ambassador for open borders and climate change, but he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s getting a nasty surprise, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all thanks to the Muslim migrants whom he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s there to defend. He will be shouted down for his pro-Islamist stance after a news anchor was just attacked on live TV by ruthless refugees. This has sparked new protests all over Italy. According to Breitbart, police investigating the incident said, ‚ÄoeThis type of aggression is unacceptable and casts a haunting shadow on press freedom in our country, on security conditions in Italy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s largest station, and also on the possibility of violence towards a young woman working in the center of our capital.‚Äù The news director said he felt ‚Äoeguilty‚Äù for having sent a woman out to report from the station late at night and also said the case ‚Äoeraises serious questions‚Äù about how somewhere in the center of Rome was able to become a ‚Äoeno man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s land‚Äù where attacks are commonplace, with no fanfare nor acknowledgement from the liberal media. It becomes ‚Äoeno man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s land‚Äù when you have hundreds of migrants sleeping on the street, feeling entitled to food and a bed. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s strange that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all Muslim men and no Muslim women out on those streets, which proves these migrants aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t in Italy just to find a job. In fact, the Islamic State tells them to populate Europe for nefarious reasons. Well, old Obama will have a hard time selling his Islamic dreams to the Italians, and he has his own pet population of Muslims to blame. Italians, like many throughout the West, have had enough of the migrants terrorizing their women and organizing terror attacks on their churches. Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s words will fall on deaf ears; Italians are suffering and they are trying to take their country back again.
