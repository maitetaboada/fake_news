BRAMPTON, ON ‚Ä" After the arrest of golf great Tiger Woods on a DUI charge on Monday, fans and friends of the four-time Masters winner have been dealing with disappointment- but none have been more disappointed than Brampton native Geoff Womack, widely known until this week as ‚Äoethe Tiger Woods of impaired driving‚Äù. ‚ÄoeLook, I drive impaired, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what I do. Impaired driving is my art form. The car is my canvas, and booze and/or drugs are my brush,‚Äù lamented a crestfallen Womack. ‚ÄoeI do it a lot and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m good at it, is what I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m saying. I am‚Ä¶ I WAS‚Ä¶ regarded as the Tiger Woods of impaired driving. But now I guess the Tiger Woods of impaired driving is just the actual Tiger Woods. So yeah, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s terrific.‚Äù Now that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been thrust into direct completion with Woods himself, Womack says he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not optimistic about reclaiming the distinction. ‚ÄoeNow that Mr. Champion of the World is playing my sport, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have a chance. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know anyone who impaired-drives like I do, but that guy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dad raised him to be a weird competition winning robot,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄoeAnd now he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s saying he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even drunk, he was just on mixed medication? I wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even have thought of doing it on mixed medication! That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the king.‚Äù Womack says he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s already lost several endorsements since Monday, and has also abandoned his screenplay for a Space Jam-esque film where he and Yosemite Sam drink a bottle of cough syrup and drive a Kia through a farmers market, because ‚Äoeit doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make sense anymore.‚Äù Despite losing his title, Womack has received several messages of encouragement on social media, including a Facebook post telling him to ‚ÄoeStay positive, it gets better‚Äù from Orlando‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Walter Cobb, serial adulterer and ‚ÄoeThe Tiger Woods of cheating on your wife‚Äù until 2009.
