By Margaret Dyer Enough is enough. Kathleen Wynneâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Liberals have shown that are completely unable to run this province. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m tired of incompetence, of cronyism, and of corporations coming first. Thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s why on June 7th of next year Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll be voting forâ€"oh. Ohâ€¦ Look, I know weâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve made a lot of great social strides in the last few years but social issues are only one side of governing. Patrick Brown has done a lot recently to show in good faith that heâ€" hmm, waitâ€¦ in 2013 he still voted against amendments to make the Humans Rights Act more inclusive? Yeesh. Why would somebody everâ€¦? Well wait. Let me reconsider the Ontario NDP. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s been a long time since the Bob Rae days. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll vote for Andrea Horwath, who stands alone at the politicalâ€¦ centre? No, wait, that was where she stood in 2011, I thinkâ€¦ The centre-right maybe? Nope, that was 2014. Hmm. Hmm. Maybe I will just vote Libâ€"actually no, definitely not, because now Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m remembering eHealth, the gas plants, and now goddamn Hydro. God, these shitty Liberals. You know, I guess 2018 is gonna be a spit in the bucket anyway. When I really think about it, it would probably take even the best possible leader at least 20 years to fix Ontarioâ€<sup>TM</sup>s systemic economic problems and that even then theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>d probably fuck it up and make potatoes cost $300 a bag or something like that. So, what the hell. My name is Margaret Dyer, and on June 7th of next year Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll be voting for the Green Party of Ontario, or something. Jesus, I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know. Fuck.
