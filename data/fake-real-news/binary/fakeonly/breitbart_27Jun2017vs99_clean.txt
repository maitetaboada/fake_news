In December 2014, Huth accused Cosby of allegedly forcing her to perform a sex act with him at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles in 1974. Huth, who is being represented by attorney Gloria Allred, was just 15 years old at the time. Judge Karlan set a tentative date of July 30, 2018 for the beginning of the civil case trial, according to the Associated Press.

Constand‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s is the sole criminal case against the comedian, after more than fifty women have accused him of sexual assault or harassment; many of the alleged assaults have exceeded the statute of limitations. Cosby has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, pleaded not guilty, and insisted that his encounter with Constand was consensual.

Judge Karlan reportedly scheduled the upcoming trial for July of next year on the assumption that the former television star would be retried this fall in Pennsylvania. ‚ÄoeMs. Huth is committed to this civil case, no matter the result of the criminal case against Mr. Cosby,‚Äù Allred told reporters Tuesday outside a Santa Monica, California courthouse. ‚ÄoeIt is not dependent on the outcome of the criminal case.
