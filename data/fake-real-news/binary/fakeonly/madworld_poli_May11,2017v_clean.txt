It was a tough day for the ladies of The View. Their guest, Condoleezza Rice, brought more intelligence to the show than the liberal ladies could handle. When they tried to pin Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s election loss on Russia, the former Secretary of State put them in their place and made them look like idiots in front of their own audience. According to The Gateway Pundit, The View‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hostesses wanted to hear Rice say that Vladimir Putin and Russia made President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s election illegitimate. However, her rational answer left them sorely disappointed. Host Sunny Hostin tried to get back to the Russian hacking question again, asking bluntly: HOSTIN: But Madam Secretary, if he indeed did engage in these types of tactics in our election, then the very legitimacy of our election is at issue, isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t it? Rice immediately shot that narrative down, as grasping at straws and showing a mistrust in the American people‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s intelligence. RICE: No, no. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s where I ‚Ä" first of all, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to question his motives beyond he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s an eye for an eye kind of person. Secondly, I trust the people who voted in Wisconsin and Texas and Alabama and California to have voted on the basis of who they thought was best going to represent their interests. And so I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not going to question the legitimacy of their vote because Vladimir Putin tried to interfere in the elections. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just a step that I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think we should take. Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s trust our fellow citizens to have been smart enough to have voted for the people they thought they ought to be voting for. According to News Busters, perhaps Rice‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s most significant comment to the left-wing ladies was: ‚ÄoeSo, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t let him get the satisfaction of thinking that we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe our own elections to be legitimate.‚Äù Hillary Clinton supporters, like those who host The View, want to believe that Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s win was not legitimate. It makes them feel better about themselves and their worldview to pretend that an evil white man cheated his way into the White House. There is likely a part of them that knows Donald Trump won fair and square because the American electorate had grown tired of the corrupt, divisive tactics of Hillary Clinton and those like her, Barack Obama included. Ultimately, the truth about the election is not important to many liberals, as their quest for power dictates that they must delegitimize President Trump anyway that they can. Times are tough for liberals, but one thing has remained constant for them: they have to lie and manipulate facts in order to stay relevant. Otherwise, their entire demented worldview would have died off long ago.
