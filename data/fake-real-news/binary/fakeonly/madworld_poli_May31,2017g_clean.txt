Although First Lady Melania Trump has remained in New York since her husband‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s inauguration so that their son, Barron, could finish school, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s finally time to make the White House her home. However, it seems that her presence has left people speechless after getting rid of her predecessor‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s most prized possessions before her arrival ‚Ä" and Michelle Obama probably isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t laughing. After the most recent stunts to come out of the left, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really no wondering why Melania wanted to keep her son from the public spotlight for as long as possible. However, the time has finally come for the two to join President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., but there is going to be at least one major change. According to Opposing Views, Melania is actually reducing the East Wing in both its agenda and finances. Most importantly, she is downsizing her staff to just 10 people which is a stark contrast to Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s previous 26 paid employees, according to Canada Free Press. We all know how much Michelle liked being waited on hand and foot. Even better yet, that means that the approximate $1,750,000 spent annually on wages for Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s staffers will be drastically reduced and cut by more than half. Of course, that will be less of a burden on U.S. taxpayers. As if that wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t enough, Melania has also come forward saying that she will be focusing on one single issue during her tenure as First Lady. Currently, speculation seems to indicate that she will be fighting ‚Äoecyberbullying‚Äù but that has yet to be officially declared. This is yet another drastic contrast to Michelle since the former First Lady tried to achieve two different things, known as her ‚ÄoeLet‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Move!‚Äù and ‚ÄoeLet Girls Learn‚Äù campaigns ‚Ä" both of which were tremendous failures. Unlike Michelle, Melania isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t using the power of her office to tell Americans how they should parent by attempting to micromanage everything other people‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s children put in their mouths. As for Michelle, well, it was abundantly clear where she really stood on the ‚Äoehealthy lunches‚Äù aspect as she and her two daughters were seen in public stuffing their faces with whatever they pleased. Showing off her royalty mindset, she may as well have come out and said, ‚Äoelet them eat cake,‚Äù when it came to the millions of American children complaining that they were hungry because of her program. Melania, on the other hand, used a November 3 campaign speech to address the effects of cyberbullying. ‚ÄoeWe must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media,‚Äù she said in her speech, according to Time. ‚ÄoeIt will be one of the main focuses of my work if I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m privileged enough to become your first lady.‚Äù It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nice to have a couple in the White House who actually cares about their country more than themselves. This is a great place to live, but it has been used and abused by so many leftists that it hardly resembles what it once was. Fortunately, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s where the Trumps come in. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to make American great again.
