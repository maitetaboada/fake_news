Chelsea Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s recent book signing event in New York City was interrupted by a ‚Äoespecial guest‚Äù who made an unexpected appearance. Upon making one seemingly simple request, the book signing descended into what could only be emotional chaos for the only Clinton child, and it was all caught on tape. Unfortunately for Chelsea, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s unlikely anyone has any sympathy for her. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Chelsea‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s new book ‚ÄoeShe Persisted‚Äù was written for children about ‚Äoethirteen inspirational women.‚Äù According to the book‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Google description, ‚ÄoeChelsea Clinton introduces tiny feminists, mini-activists, and little kids who are ready to take on the world to thirteen inspirational women who never took no for an answer, and who always, inevitably and without fail, persisted.‚Äù Tiny feminists? Give me a break! If there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s one thing the world doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t need right now, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s an army of ‚Äoetiny feminists‚Äù who look up to Chelsea Clinton. ‚ÄoeI wrote this book for everyone who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ever wanted to speak up but has been told to quiet down, for everyone who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ever been made to feel less than,‚Äù Chelsea said about the children‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s book. Apparently, though, she meant everyone accept Juanita Broaddrick, who alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton ‚Ä" the former president and Chelsea‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s philandering father ‚Ä" but has never received any semblance of justice. Still, Broaddrick has persisted, telling her story to anyone who will listen. You would think that Juanita Broaddrick would be the poster child for a book written about ‚Äoewomen who never took no for an answer,‚Äù even as those more powerful tried to silence them. Although I guess in Broaddrick‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s case, it was Bill who wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take no for an answer. But, I digress. When Laura Loomer, a commentator for Rebel Media, showed up at Chelsea‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s recent book signing in New York City and asked the author to sign a copy for ‚Äoemy friend Juanita Broaddrick, a woman who was silenced, but persisted,‚Äù Chelsea flatly refused, making for quite the awkward video clip. ‚ÄoeBecause this book‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s for everyone, including women who have never wanted to speak up but have been told to quiet down, can you sign it for my friend Juanita Broaddrick because she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been silenced by your parents, especially Bill Clinton who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a rapist?‚Äù asked Loomer. ‚ÄoeCan you sign it for her?‚Äù Clearly unamused, Chelsea thanked Loomer for coming and opted not to sign her copy of ‚ÄoeShe Persisted.‚Äù The footage is now going viral, generating far more buzz than Chelsea‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s boring book signing did, to begin with. Isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t it ironic that those on the left have mercilessly attacked Ivanka Trump for not ‚Äoestanding up to her father,‚Äù a man they have accused of persecuting women without any hard evidence? Meanwhile, multiple women have come forward saying they were assaulted by Bill Clinton over the years, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve yet to meet a liberal who expected Chelsea to condemn her dad for his constant victimization of the opposite sex. Donald Trump and his daughter have worked tirelessly to help women and build them up, while the Clintons have literally had their female adversaries silenced by any means necessary. Still, the Clintons are hailed as heroes by an entire misguided political party. It makes absolutely no sense. But, then, no one ever accused a liberal of having much common sense.
