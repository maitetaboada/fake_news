The worst liberal nutjobs out in Hollywood are completely melting down after they got a nasty surprise from President Donald Trump. Cher, Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell, Chelsea Handler, and Katy Perry are all mentally unhinged as if they can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go on living. Patriots are laughing at their antics and applauding Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s role in sending them into a full-blown meltdown. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to love this. Climate change is the one issue that the Hollywood crowd has adopted, and they are rabid about it. Nevermind that global warming is not a science nor has it been proven that humans are causing temperatures to climb. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the ultimate hoax issue, but celebrities act as if it was the most important thing in the world right now. So, President Trump just shattered their climate change cause by pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s causing utter armageddon with the rich and famous. Trump was elected by middle-class Americans who want job growth and energy independence, which cannot happen if the U.S. stays in the Paris Agreement. ‚ÄoeTrump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s EPA Secretary Scott Pruitt and White House senior advisor Stephen K. Bannon urged the president to keep his campaign promise to kill the agreement and put American energy and job growth first,‚Äù reported Breitbart. Last year, Trump said, ‚ÄoeIt will get a little warmer, then it will get a little cooler, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s called weather. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>man-made,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a scam, and America has bigger problems than to suck up to European leaders who can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t balance their budgets.‚Äù Those liberal Hollywood climate change nuts are melting down on social media. Cher, Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell, Katy Perry, and Chelsea Handler are all unhinged. Trump has gotten back at them for all the crude remarks they have made about him almost on a daily basis. 2 Ppl of The .Pls Know There R "MILLIONS"Of Us ing Held Hostage By Insane DICTATOR‚ÄºÔ∏èHe Trashesüá∫üá∏'n Values &Admires Killers #ParisAccordNOW ‚Ä" Cher () May 31, 2017 and thats donald for sure #resist ‚Ä" ROSIE () May 31, 2017 Only an ignorant psychopath willing to endanger his own grandchildren would pull out of #ParisAgreement. #Covfefehttps:// ‚Ä" Lisa Bloom () May 31, 2017 Yeah, who cares about climate change? Only every single person with a child. Republicans in congress need to end this childish mayhem. ‚Ä" Chelsea Handler () May 31, 2017 ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a bad deal. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d cause a heavy, unfair burden on US businesses and ultimately hurt our economy. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d force the US to invest in renewable energy, and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not saying renewable energy is a bad thing, but when the government tries to make something happen, it usually fails. We know from experience,‚Äù reports Chicks on the Right. A study by the Chamber of Commerce revealed that the regulations we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d have to put in place to hold up our end of the deal would ‚Äoecost the U.S. industrial sector 1.1 million jobs.‚Äù What‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s more, the electricity costs for a family of four would‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve increased anywhere from 13 to 20 percent annually, according to Breitbart. We elected Trump to put America first. Ever wonder why Angela Merkel and that new liberal idiot the French elected, Emmanuel Macron, are so desperate for the U.S. to stay in the agreement? They need our money, it gives them the right to regulate American businesses to have to pay to be compliant with their job killing regulations. We would also have to give them money to stay in the agreement. Screw that, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ridiculous. President Trump is taking the heat from all the liberal fanatics who believe this is some kind of global emergency; what fools they truly are. Do they not educate themselves on what is really going on? No, they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. Thank God for Donald Trump. The right man, at the right time, for the right reasons, and those idiots in Hollywood are free to leave this country anytime. We really wish they would go to France or Germany, where they can pay high taxes for a junk science scheme.
