During the ‚ÄoeOpening Statement‚Äù segment of her Fox News program on Saturday, Judge Jeanine Pirro let loose on James Comey, launching into a must-see rant against the disgraced former FBI Director who she called a ‚Äoedrama queen.‚Äù You can always count on Pirro to say what we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve all been thinking without holding back or fearing the PC Police, and you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this as it might just be her finest moment yet. ‚ÄoeAre you schizo?‚Äù asked Pirro. ‚ÄoeAre you the same guy who held a press conference to do what has never been done in the history of this country, and announced to the world that no reasonable prosecutor would indict Hillary?‚Äù she added. ‚ÄoeDo you have delusions of grandeur?‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄoeYou spend a lot of time talking about your emotions.‚Äù Pirro noted that while testifying last week before the Senate intelligence committee, Comey painted himself as the victim while calling President Donald Trump a liar. ‚ÄoeYou sound like a two-year old, grow up!‚Äù she declared. Pirro pointed out that by his own admission, Comey may have violated the Federal Records Act when he leaked information to The New York Times, as he admitted to doing. Questioning whether his agenda was ‚Äoeto proliferate anti-Trump hate,‚Äù she blasted Comey over his comment to the Senate panel that it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t his place to determine whether Trump committed obstruction of justice. [Source: BizPac Review] On Thursday, James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he had leaked a conversation he had with President Donald Trump to the New York Times with the help of a close friend, Columbia University professor Daniel Richman. Ironically, it amounted to the same exact crime he once prosecuted General David Petraeus for committing. Richman confirmed to reporters the same day that he was, indeed, the confidante Comey had used to leak sensitive information to the press. Then, he disappeared from his Brooklyn home and has not been seen since, adding to the controversy surrounding Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s testimony. ‚ÄoeThe truth, Jim, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re a political operative,‚Äù concluded Pirro on Saturday. ‚ÄoeYou always have been. One who is addicted to drama.‚Äù (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); "The greatest political hoax since Eve convinced Adam to eat that apple is being spun by Jim Comey."Last night on "Justice," Judge Jeanine Pirro said that former FBI Director James Comey is engaged in a "conspiracy worthy of a Greek tragedy." Posted by Fox News on Sunday, June 11, 2017 It certainly appears that Judge Jeanine Pirro is correct in her unabashed assessment of James Comey, who was once a well-respected pillar of American justice. His career began spiraling out of control with the investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s private email server, and it was all downhill from there. They say karma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a bitch, and Comey is definitely learning all about that right now.
