Liberals are doing everything that they can to tie President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s firing of now-former FBI Director James Comey to the Russia narrative, even though absolutely no evidence exists whatsoever. However, one national security expert has now unearthed the real reason that Comey was canned, and liberals are furious. As Washington Free Beacon reports, Trump fired Comey after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommended that he do so on grounds that the FBI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s reputation and credibility had ‚Äoesuffered substantial damage.‚Äù Rosenstein‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s three-page memo to Trump also criticized Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal. ‚ÄoeThe director was wrong to usurp the attorney general‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution,‚Äù the memo stated. ‚ÄoeIt is not the function of the director to make such an announcement. At most, the director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors.‚Äù Liberals appear to either love or hate Comey, depending on which direction the political winds are blowing, but for the most part, they have chosen to press the ‚ÄoeTrump colluded with Russia narrative‚Äù to explain his defeat of Hillary Clinton. Even Hillary herself has said, ‚ÄoeI was on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s letter on Oct. 28 and Russian Wikileaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄoeAnd the evidence for that intervening event is compelling, persuasive.‚Äù So, confused liberals say that Comey was fired because he was investigating Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s alleged ties to Russia, while the Trump administration says that he was fired for diminishing the FBI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s reputation and credibility. Now, Catherine Herridge, a Fox News national security expert, has come forward with more compelling evidence that led to Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s removal, and liberals are not at all happy to hear the news. As reported by The Gateway Pundit, Herridge said, ‚ÄoeThe accusation against the former FBI director, and this comes mostly from Republicans, is that he has been sort of slow walking records about the Americans who were identified or unmasked in these intelligence reports and providing them to Congress.‚Äù She continued, ‚ÄoeAnd the reason that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a big deal is that everyone in the IC, in the intelligence community, knows that there is no bigger, deeper, wider, extensive paper trail than there is when you unmask or identify an American citizen. And it should not take months. It should take weeks if not the course of several days to know who was unmasked and who made those requests and that has not been provided.‚Äù Video of Herridge‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s comments can be seen, below: In the minds of the left, James Comey should have been fired for releasing the letter regarding Hillary Clinton during the election, but then he became a hero for investigating President Trump and Russia. Given that this latest bombshell would make another liberal icon, Barack Obama, look bad, it is likely that the left will ignore the revelation, if they can, and continue to whine about Russia. This is typical Democrat strategy. Point fingers and hide the truth. Time will tell if the tactic will continue to work in the era of Trump, but if the last six months are any indicator, it will not.
