TORONTO ‚Ä" After a long, fulfilling career as a screed-writer for one of Canada‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s newspapers of note, columnist Eustace Tibbs has retired to spend more time disparaging his children. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m forever grateful to the Post for teaching me how to phrase unworthy thoughts in an elegant way,‚Äù said Tibbs. ‚ÄoeBut it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to start spewing bile onto the people I really care about.‚Äù Since joining the Post‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s editorial board in 1998, Tibbs has used his platform to sneer at a variety of people: from gay marriage advocates (‚Ä<sup>~</sup>godless oysterboys‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>), to climate scientists (‚Ä<sup>~</sup>charlatans‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>), indigenous activists (‚Ä<sup>~</sup><unpublishable slur>‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>), and feminists (‚Ä<sup>~</sup>shrieking violets‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>). But years of long hours have meant missed hockey games, school plays, and ballet recitals, each one a milestone in his children‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lives that could have been heckled, lambasted, or shit all over. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m persuaded his children will be elated to observe more of him,‚Äù said Post founder Conrad Black, employing the publication‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s characteristic sarcasm in an absolutely withering farewell speech. ‚ÄoeEustace Tibbs is the sort of person often bequeathed with the sardonic appellation of, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>father of the year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>: a suitable euphemism for ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>having accomplished nothing better‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>.‚Äù Black then smiled thinly at his own joke instead of laughing, which he never does. ‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care what Mr. Black says, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m happy to see more of my dad,‚Äù said Tibb‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s son, Kyle, an intellectual welterweight who squanders his eyesight on middlebrow publications like the Toronto Star. ‚ÄoeI know he loves me, even though he said my science project was ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>the work of two apes sharing one brain, and the brain a monkey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s brain at that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>.‚Äù This marks the first time a National Post columnist has actually retired, instead of bursting into a damp cloud of mold spores.
