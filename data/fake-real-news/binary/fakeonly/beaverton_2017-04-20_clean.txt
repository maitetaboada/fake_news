HALIFAX ‚Ä" Four hours after a striking a massive iceberg, the Province of Newfoundland has sunk off the coast of Labrador leaving an unknown number of survivors. All contact was lost with Canada‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s most-easterly province early this morning. Skipper Dwight Ball, who was reportedly at the helm in St. John‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s, tried to steer Newfoundland hard to starboard when they came too close to a mountain of ice, but it was too late. The 520,000 residents on-board the large landmass were awoken by a large crash at 11:49 PM NT and the land quickly took on water. A distress signal was sent to neighbouring PEI, but everyone was in bed by that time. ‚ÄoeThey called it ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>The Rock‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>; a province that wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sink,‚Äù lamented Fisheries and Oceans Minister Dominic LeBlanc in an emergency press conference. ‚ÄoeI can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe they kept Newfoundland in the ocean with all of those icebergs at this time of year.‚Äù Newfoundland was added to Canada‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s provinces in 1949 and previously thought to be invincible to any wave or iceberg. ‚ÄoeTo think, people thought it was a tourist attraction,‚Äù LeBlanc added shaking his head. ‚ÄoeThis is the worst provincial navigation disaster in our country‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s history.‚Äù According to survivors, Great Big Sea proudly played ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Ordinary Day‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> as they went down with Newfoundland.
