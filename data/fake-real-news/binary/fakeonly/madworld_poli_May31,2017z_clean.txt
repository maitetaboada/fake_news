The Clinton family has proven, time and time again, that they have virtually no sense of self-accountability, and people around the world are, quite frankly, tired of it. Unfortunately for Chelsea Clinton, she just learned that the hard way after she launched an attack on the President of the Philippines ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about the time he put her in her place with one unexpected question. Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte has made quite a name for himself as he demolishes the corrupt establishment that leftist put in place in his country over the years. Just as President Donald Trump has promised to ‚Äoedrain the swamp,‚Äù that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly what Duterte is doing ‚Ä" but in a much more assertive way. Completely casting sentiments and professionalism aside, to say that ‚Äoepolitical correctness‚Äù is a distant thought for Duterte would be a bit of an understatement. Of course, as a result of this reality, international leftists everywhere hate him. However, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s his lack of filter and care that means things aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t going to change anytime soon. In fact, he was able to prove just that most recently after Chelsea Clinton, of all people, decided to attack him. According to The Gateway Pundit, ‚ÄoeDuterte lashed out at Chelsea Clinton after she attacked him for his joke about troops raping women.‚Äù For those unaware, the Philippines President made a joke about his soldiers that many believe went too far. Saying that he would allow his soldiers to rape up to three women each and he would ‚Äoetake responsibility‚Äù as they battle ISIS-linked rebels on the island of Mindanao, well, let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just say it didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go over too well. Despite saying that he was being sarcastic at the time, the left didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem to buy his story. In fact, news of his comment quickly spread around the globe, prompting Chelsea to comment, ‚ÄoeNot funny. Ever,‚Äù on social media. She would later write in another post, ‚ÄoeDuterte is a murderous thug with no regard for human rights. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s important to keep pointing that out and that rape is never a joke.‚Äù Too bad for her, she apparently never got the memo on poking bears. ‚ÄoeThese whores, they hear ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>rape.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Like, like Chelsea, she slammed me. I was not joking, I was being sarcastic. Listen to the speech. I do not laugh at my own jokes,‚Äù said Duterte, 72, according to Mail Online. ‚ÄoeI will tell her, when your father, the President of the United States, was f*cking Lewinsky and the girls in the White House, how did you feel? Did you slam your father?‚Äù As one would imagine, those five words at the end were enough to shut her up about the matter. After all, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no arguing that her father is perhaps one of the most notorious rapists on the planet ‚Ä" yet Chelsea only ever has kind words for him. Unfortunately for her, this was not a happy ending for the Clinton family. Then again, the evidence of the last happy ending that any member of that family had was all over Monica Lewinski‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s blue dress. Always remember folks, take a good hard look in the mirror before attacking someone else. If Chelsea did, she may not have humiliated herself on the world‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s stage.
