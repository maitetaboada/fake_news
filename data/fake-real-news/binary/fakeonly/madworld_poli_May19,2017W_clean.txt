Even Democrats are beginning to come out of the woodwork to admit the existence of an elusive ‚Äoedeep state,‚Äù which is systematically working to take down President Donald Trump. A former candidate for president is now speaking out to alert the American people to this scary scenario. During a Wednesday appearance on Fox News‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Hannity, former Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), who ran for president in 2004 and 2008, said the actions of the ‚Äoedeep state‚Äù ‚Ä" a group of influential government employees trying to manipulate policy ‚Ä" have the Trump administration ‚Äoeunder attack from within.‚Äù ‚ÄoeWell, you have a politicization of the agencies. That is resulting in leaks from anonymous, unknown people and the intention is to take down a president,‚Äù said Kucinich, according to BizPacReview. ‚ÄoeThis is very dangerous to America. It is a threat to our republic. It constitutes a clear and present danger to our way of life,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄoeWe have to be asking: What is the motive of these people? Who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s putting these leaks out? Why isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t somebody coming forward to make that charge and put their name and their reputation behind it instead of attacking through the media and not substantiating their position?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄoeThis isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t about one president, this is about the political process of the United States of America being under attack by intelligence agencies and individuals in those agencies, yes, as you said there might be good people in there, but there are certain individuals who are lifers who want to be able to direct the policy of the country,‚Äù added Kucinich, as reported by Western Journalism. ‚ÄoeAnd if the president stands in their way whether it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a Democrat or Republican, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll just try to run that person out,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄoeWe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got to protect our nation here. People have to be aware of what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going on. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got to stand up for America. This isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t about Democrat, Republican. This is about getting what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going on in the moment and understanding that our country itself is under attack from within.‚Äù Those who deny the existence of a deep state, or that there are forces within our own government working against the president, need to open their eyes. They say ignorance is bliss, but just wait until the greatest republic in the world crumbles from the inside out. Those who turned a blind eye from the beginning will only have themselves to blame for the destruction and chaos which ensues.
