As each rapper recites their lyrics, scenes of refugees and immigrants doing various jobs are intermingled throughout. The video features contributions from Rogue One: A Star Wars Story actor Riz Ahmed as well as rappers K‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Naan and Snow Tha Product. ‚ÄoeThis election cycle has brought xenophobia and vilification of immigrants back to the forefront of US politics,‚Äù Miranda wrote in a post on the website Genius. ‚ÄoeThis is a musical counterweight.‚Äù Miranda‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚ÄoeImmigrants‚Äù video is part of the Oscar-winner‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ongoing Prizeo #Ham4All campaign, which sees Miranda asking fans and celebrities to post videos to social media of themselves singing Hamilton songs.
