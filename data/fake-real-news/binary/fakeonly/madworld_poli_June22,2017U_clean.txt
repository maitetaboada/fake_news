Texas mom Claudia Sierra is planning to undergo eight plastic surgery procedures, including a breast reduction, rhinoplasty, liposuction, a Brazilian buttock lift, and an eyelid lift. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s doing it all to look like one famous woman in particular, and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the only one rushing to do so. Liberals are now furious over this new trend after catching a glimpse of who Sierra hopes to resemble. The media fawned over Michelle Obama when she was the first lady as if she had single-handedly stopped starvation and somehow achieved world peace in the same day. In reality, though, she was one of the most loathsome first lady‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s our country has ever had the displeasure of hosting in the White House for eight years. Michelle spent obscene amounts of taxpayer money trying to look good ‚Ä" the optimum word being ‚Äoetrying‚Äù ‚Ä" but not even the most expensive makeup artists in the world could make her ugly mug into something another woman would pay big bucks to duplicate. Then, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Melania Trump, a natural beauty and former model who can still compete with young twenty-somethings. Much to Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dismay, other women are booking appointments with their plastic surgeons in order to get Melania‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s signature look, which has become so popular that it now has its own name. One Texas mom is taking the term ‚Äoerole model‚Äù to another level. Claudia Sierra underwent eight procedures Tuesday to change her mug to resemble First Lady Melania Trump. Sierra‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s plastic surgeon, Dr. Franklin Rose, said she is one of many patients who have requested the ‚ÄoeMelania makeover.‚Äù [Source: Fox News] ‚ÄoeI want to feel like the First Lady that I know I am inside,‚Äù Sierra said in a press release on Dr. Rose‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s website, according to Daily Mail. ‚ÄoeMelania for me illustrates power and strength; she is our First Lady and I am looking forward to more closely resembling her and becoming a better version of ME and for it to show on the outside.‚Äù She isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the only one, either. Apparently, the ‚ÄoeMelania makeover‚Äù is really taking off in popularity, as woman rush into Rose‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s office requesting a look similar to the first lady‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s. ‚ÄoeI have had many women visit my office wanting the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Ivanka Look‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and so it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not really surprising to see women now requesting to look more like Melania, who is simply gorgeous,‚Äù said Rose.

Stay tuned to see Claudia's BIG REVEAL to be featured on Inside Edition in the upcoming weeks ~ Posted by Franklin Rose on Wednesday, June 7, 2017 Of course, this must feel like a giant slap in the face to all of the liberal designers who have refused to dress Melania in recent months for no reason other than their misguided political bias. Women want to look like Melania, and they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re willing to shell out quite a bit of money to achieve this goal. If high-end designers were smart, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be rushing to dress the first lady, as their garments would subsequently be flying off the racks. For now, I suppose, it will be the plastic surgeons of the world capitalizing off of Melania‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s signature look, one which invokes all of the style and grace the country has yearned for in a first lady for years.
