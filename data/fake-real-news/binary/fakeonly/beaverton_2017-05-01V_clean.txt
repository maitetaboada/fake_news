VICTORIA ‚Ä" In a bid to soften their corporate reputation in time for election day, the BC Liberals have rolled out a Groupon offer, so voters can glad-hand with Christy Clark for a discount on her usual rate. ‚Äoe50% off, wowee!‚Äù said everyday British Columbian, Emily Smith. ‚ÄoeAt that price, my friends and I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t afford not to exert undue influence over the political process.‚Äù The ad, which can be seen in the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Local‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> section of the Groupon app, features a stock photo of a female executive and the headline, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Meet British Columbia premier, $20,000 now only $10,400!‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> But unfortunately for Clark‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s polling numbers, public response to the offer has been lacklustre. ‚ÄoeChristy and her friends arrived late, then yelled at my girlfriend and I for being NDP plants when we asked about campaign finance reform,‚Äù read one one-star review. ‚ÄoeWorst date ever.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> At press time, Pacific Northwest LNG had already purchased all the remaining Groupons.
