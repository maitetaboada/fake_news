Anti-Trump thugs who may also be aligned with the Antifa movement have terrorized a whole neighborhood in Georgia where GOP candidate Karen Handel lives. Calling for the death of all ‚Äoecollaborators,‚Äù these far leftist thugs are so out of control that they won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be happy until they kill people who they see as pro-Trump. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be shocked at how organized they are, and you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be sick when you find out what they put in the mailboxes in Georgia. Police have blocked off Georgia Republican Karen Handel‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s neighborhood after reports that letters containing a white powdery substance and calling Handel a ‚Äoedirty fascist‚Äù were left at homes of her neighbors. Cops have been going from mailbox to mailbox after finding the ‚Äoesuspicious package,‚Äù according to local reports, which also indicate that Roswell Police continue to flood to the area. A neighborhood resident posted a picture on Facebook of the contents of the envelope. She said that several letters were distributed and that they contained white powder. She also related that most of her neighbors were ‚Äoeconservative‚Äù voters and that Karen Handel had supported Donald Trump. Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the really strange part, the nutjob, James Hodgkinson, who shot up GOP congressmen, had also mentioned Handel on his Facebook page, and now, this happens. It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem like a coincidence. Luckily, police found the white substance to be made up of mostly baby powder, reported WSB-TV. The threatening letter, posted below, also contained graphic language. ‚ÄoeYour neighbor Karen Handel is a dirty fascist c*nt but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sure you already knew that,‚Äù the letter says, according to a picture. ‚ÄoeTake a whiff of the powder and join her in the hospital you Bourgeoisie motherf*ckers. RESIST THE FASCIST TAKEOVER!!!!,‚Äù it adds. ‚Äù STRING UP THE COLLABORATORS!‚Äù The use of the word ‚Äoefascist‚Äù sounds like members of the Antifa crowd, who are into violence as we have all witnessed. The Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa, and we can look forward to more deaths and violence as these thugs go unchecked. Pamela Gellar compares those on the far left who did this as taking a page out of the Islamic terrorist playbook. ‚ÄoeThe left has declared war. The time is fast approaching. The Democrat-hajids are emulating their brother-in-arms, the jihadis,‚Äù she said. The incident comes just after a politically motivated shooting was carried out against Republicans practicing for Thursday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s congressional baseball game. Among the Republicans targeted by the shooter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s social media rants were Handel, who was labeled by the man as a ‚ÄoeRepublican bitch.‚Äù ‚ÄoeRepublican Bitch Wants People to Work for Slave Wages, when a Livable Wage is the Only Way to Go! Vote Blue, It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Right for You!‚Äù James Hodgkinson wrote on Facebook, according to The Washington Free Beacon. This is beyond just being not acceptable and is now getting way out of control. It looks like a coordinated effort by those who know of Hodgkinson, and they were carrying out his wishes. One Florida Sheriff told his citizens to make sure they had a weapon and to get all the proper training on how to fire a gun. Has it come to that? Unfortunately, the answer seems to be a resounding yes. The far left in this country is hellbent on violence to take over our nation. They are targeting GOP congressmen and candidates, and now, they have terrorized regular citizens right in their homes. We must protect our freedom and our families because these thugs won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop. They won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t win, but they will continue to do these sick vile stunts. So, be prepared, but don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be scared. They are just a bunch of ignorant thugs who will find out the hard way not to mess with armed patriotic Americans.
