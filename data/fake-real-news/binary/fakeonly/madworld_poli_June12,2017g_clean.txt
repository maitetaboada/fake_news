Hollywood celebrities, led by Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell and Cher, are having epic meltdowns over President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s policies, which they claim will ‚Äoekill American women.‚Äù These idiots are ratcheting up hatred from the liberal loons who are believing their lies. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s getting so bad that the president has a nasty surprise for those dimwits who say they speak for all American women. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. It started with Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell and Cher on social media posting ridiculous accusations about President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s promised change to take out Obamacare and replace it with something that won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bankrupt the country. As many Americans know, Obamacare was failing, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s vital that we get government out of our insurance as much as possible. Feds ordered to pay more than $200 million to Obamacare insurer after short-changing it, and others STARVES ACA ‚Ä" Cher () June 6, 2017 Rosie has been retweeting others, like actress Alyssa Milano whose tweets are of women who claim Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s out to kill women, gays, Latinos, and even babies because only Obamacare can save those people. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s how ignorant these people are, when in fact, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Obamacare that had, in essence, death panels. Twitchy weighed in on the Hollywood crowd telling us what to do, reporting, ‚ÄoeDon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry, little people, Hollywood will PROTECT YOU! Maybe it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just us, but the notion that some Hollywood has-beens feel the need to get between constituents and their elected officials is sorta self-centered and smug. As if they aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t important enough for their elected officials to pay attention to them without them. Insulting.‚Äù Below are some of the tweets that Rosie, Cher, and Alyssa Milano are promoting. With fake tears and all, they are going to blow your mind. Caution, these women are the people the elite in Hollywood are using to promote their message, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s damn scary. Hey . This is Tabatha. She has something she'd like to say. Please watch. Please listen. #TrumpCare ‚Ä" Alyssa Milano () June 12, 2017 Hi, ! This is Sharon. She has something to say to you. Please watch. Please listen. #trumpcare ‚Ä" Alyssa Milano () June 12, 2017 There are more videos like that, but you get the idea. This is plain old fear-mongering, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s crazy that there are so many just plain stupid liberals out there who believe this crap. If these people love socialized medicine, then they can go to Cuba. As a Registered Nurse for over 20 years, I can tell you that Obamacare was the worst thing that man ever did, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s saying a lot. Besides the unethical panels of businessmen making the medical decisions on what care you got, the whole thing is failing as premiums go sky high. The Democrats have no message, not on economics, not on taxes, not on jobs, not on failing #Obamacare. They are only OBSTRUCTIONISTS! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 11, 2017 President Trump knows he has to do something, and he has a nasty surprise for all those who are whining like imbeciles. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s telling it like it is, just straight talk that is making the Hollywood celebs‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> heads explode. Not only is he the only one fighting to produce a plan, with Obamacare already in the dumpster, Trump is the only one fighting the Democrats who are playing games. ‚ÄoePresident Donald Trump on Monday touted his administration‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s legislative achievements while chastising Democrats for being ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>obstructionist,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> saying that even if he and the Republicans had ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>greatest bill in the history of the world on health care,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> it would still fail to garner any votes from Senate Democrats,‚Äù reports Politico. So, who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s killing who? The answer to that question comes down to some hard truths about healthcare. Healthcare is not a right, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a privilege. The only God-given rights we have were famously laid down in the Declaration of Independence. We have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Translated, that means we have a right to be alive and no man has a right to kill us. We have a right to freedom, and no man has a right to impede our liberty. We have a right to pursue our own way of life, choosing how we will live. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nothing in there about affordable healthcare or anything else at a low cost or even free, for that matter. Sorry for the special snowflakes that think everything should be paid for by the government, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not going to happen. Those who are legitimately poor or sick have always been cared for in this country, long before Barack Obama came along. Christian charities and hospitals have done that. Time for the Hollywood crowd to get educated on how America works best, and if they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like it, then they need to move out of the way. We are done making this country a welfare state; we are making it great, again, instead.
