Ivanka Trump was absent from her work at the White House on Wednesday and Thursday this week in order to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. However, when she emerged from her front door on Friday morning, onlookers did a double-take. President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s daughter stepped out amid the soaring temperatures in Washington, D.C., and everyone quickly noticed what she was wearing. Always fashionable, Ivanka kept cool on Friday by wearing a sleeveless black and white frock which showed off her toned arms and legs. She paired the dress with cat-eye sunglasses, a patterned clutch, and $120 sandals from her eponymous clothing collection. Ivanka Trump was the epitome of chic as she stepped out of her Washington, D.C. home on Friday, one day after choosing to skip her father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s announcement that he was withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Change treaty. The 35-year-old mom sported a short, sleeveless black and white dress, taking full advantage of the soaring Washington, D.C. temperatures, which are expected to reach 82 degrees on Friday ‚Ä" her first day back in the office after a two-day break.

President Trump went against his daughter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s advice when he announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord on Thursday, a move which left his supporters cheering and those on the opposite side of the aisle lambasting his decision. Ivanka was noticeably absent from his announcement about the Paris Agreement in the Rose Garden. The president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s daughter also took to Twitter on Thursday to wish the LGBTQ community a ‚Äoejoyful‚Äù Pride month, something Trump has all but ignored. Ivanka has certainly proven that she is her own woman, misguided as some of her views may be, and that she will not simply side with her father because she is his daughter when the two butt heads on issues. Likewise, the president has shown that he does not allow his daughter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s views to persuade him when it comes to pressing policy matters. Many were upset when Ivanka was given such a high-profile job in the White House alongside her father, but both of them have shown that they only compliment one another. Differences of opinion can be very healthy, especially in politics, when everyone is mature enough to agree to disagree. She may not see eye to eye with her father on every issue, but Ivanka Trump is certainly making an impact on Washington in her own way, and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s definitely looking great while doing it!
