While discussing CNN‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fake news scandal, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s overwhelming focus on Russia, and media bias in general, Caddell said, ‚ÄoeYou want to tell me that that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the way media should operate? They believe that it is their right to tell you who you must vote for and by the way to decide what truth you may, or may not know. And anything that counters what they want you to believe they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t cover.‚Äù Said Caddell on the healthcare bill, ‚ÄoeI think the thing has been badly, badly handled on the Republican side and the White House particularly in terms of laying predicates down, making the case on Obamacare and having a bill that explained what they were trying to do, which is unclear to me. But we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not having that.‚Äù Continued Caddell, ‚ÄoeThe White House and the Republicans have lost this debate. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve lost it to the Democrats and the mainstream media and there will be no balanced discussion of it.‚Äù ‚ÄoeI think it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dead as a doornail at this point,‚Äù he concluded.
