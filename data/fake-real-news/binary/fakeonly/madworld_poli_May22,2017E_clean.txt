Over the course of two decades, former FBI Director James Comey has been involved in four separate investigations involving the Clintons, the most recent being the investigation into Hillary‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s use of a private email server while Secretary of State. We now know the real reason Comey let her off the hook for this egregious offense and others, and it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that President Donald Trump was right to fire him. According to ABC News, Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s first encounter with the Clintons was in 1996, when he served as deputy special counsel to the Senate special committee on the Whitewater investigation, chaired by Republicans at the time, which linked Hillary Clinton to the mishandling and destruction of documents. After Comey supposedly dug into allegations that the Clintons took part in fraud connected to an Arkansas real estate venture gone bust, no charges were ultimately brought against either Clinton. Sound eerily familiar? After that, Comey was involved at both ends of the case of Marc Rich, a billionaire oil trader indicted for tax fraud and trading with Iran during the hostage crisis. Rich was later pardoned by then-President Bill Clinton during his final day in office in 2001, despite public outcry over evidence that Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ex-wife had donated to Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Senate campaign. In a letter to the Senate, Comey described working as both the lead prosecutor in New York on the original case against Rich in 1983, and then later in 2002, overseeing criminal investigations into Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s last-minute pardons. The investigations concluded there was no wrongdoing on the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s part, and shockingly, that there was no conflict of interest regarding Comey. But, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not all. Comey would go on to investigate Hillary Clinton for the use of a private email server while Secretary of State. After this investigation concluded that although there was obvious wrongdoing on the part of then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, no charges should be filed against her, Comey would ultimately decide to reopen the investigation in October 2016, subsequent to public outcry over the first. Meanwhile, Comey and members of his immediate family were profiting off deals tied to the Clintons. Comey served as general counsel at Lockheed Martin until 2010, when he departed with over $6 million to show for it. That same year, Lockheed Martin became a member of the Clinton Global Initiative and won 17 contracts from the U.S. State Department, which was led by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Comey would go on to join the board of the British bank HSBC Holdings in 2013, which just so happens to be a Clinton Foundation partner. Then, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s brother Peter, who is the Senior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas at Washington law firm DLA Piper. According to The Gateway Pundit, ‚ÄoeDLA Piper is one of the top ten all-time career campaign donors for Hillary Clinton. On top of this, DLA Piper also happens to do the Clinton Foundation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s taxes. DLA Piper performed the 2015 audit of the Clinton Foundation.‚Äù When you take a look at all the connections between James Comey and the Clintons, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really no surprise he has been deeply involved for many years in making sure they were never brought to justice for their crimes. President Trump was absolutely right to fire him as part of the ongoing effort to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.
