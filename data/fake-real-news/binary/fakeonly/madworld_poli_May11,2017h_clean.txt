Although Democrats once demanded that now-former FBI Director James Comey be fired immediately, they have now changed their tune after President Donald Trump did just that. As news and rumors around Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s termination continue to circulate, Comey penned and released a farewell letter yesterday with a message that Democrats do not want to hear. As Mail Online reports, the relationship between Trump and Comey has been troubled for some time. In March, when Trump tweeted, ‚ÄoeTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>wires tapped‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!‚Äù Comey reportedly told associates that Trump was ‚Äoecrazy‚Äù and ‚Äoeoutside the realm of normal.‚Äù Trump, on the other hand, has told his aides that there is ‚Äoesomething wrong‚Äù with Comey. It is also thought that Trump believes Comey was trying to use to Russia investigation to position himself as a martyr. As you may expect, Democrats are in confused hysterics over Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s firing as evidenced by the comments of Maxine Waters on the matter. ‚ÄoeI do not necessarily support the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s decision,‚Äù Waters said. ‚Äù I think that if the president would have fired him when he first came in, he would not have to be in a position now where he is trying to make up a story about why. It does not meet the smell test.‚Äù However, in the interview Wednesday on MSNBC, asked if she would be okay with a hypothetical President Hillary Clinton dismissing Comey from his position, Waters said yes. ‚ÄoeIf she had won the White House, I believe that given what he did to her, and what he tried to do, she should have fired him. Yes,‚Äù the California Democrat said. [Source: RealClearPolitics] So, Hillary should have fired him, but Trump should have kept him? It only makes sense in the minds of deranged liberals, but I digress. Yesterday, Comey released a farewell letter to his colleagues that Democrats like Waters would do well to heed but won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to hear. Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s opening statement says it all: I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI Director for any reason, or for no reason at all. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed. I hope you won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t either. It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply. It is almost as if James Comey was directly addressing Waters‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> absurd comments about how she thinks Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump should have handled the issue. In truth, Comey was lucky to hold onto his job as long as he did, especially in light of how he was ‚Äoevery, very good‚Äù to her, to borrow a phrase from Trump. As Business Insider reports, Trump stated that Hillary would be going to trial if not for Comey. The firestorm over Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dismissal will die down a bit in the coming days, although something tells me that the Democrats are going to try to milk the Russia narrative all the way through the next election cycle. They are choosing to ignore how President Trump angered Vladimir Putin and the Russian establishment when he fired Tomahawk missiles on Syria. We did see a slight interruption of the Russia narrative during that time, although now it is back in full swing. These are political tactics as usual from the left, but in the age of Donald Trump, they are likely to fall flat. People are tired of the lies and the narratives and they prefer authenticity. Hillary Clinton and James Comey can both attest to that.
