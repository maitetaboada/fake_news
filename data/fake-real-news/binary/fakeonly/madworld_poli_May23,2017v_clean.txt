President Donald Trump is currently in the midst of a week-long overseas trip which saw him travel to Saudi Arabia on Saturday before moving on to Israel on Monday. From there, he will fly to Brussels to meet with the prime minister and then to Sicily to participate in the annual G7 summit meetings. However, with the president busy overseas, an unforeseen emergency has occurred in front of his Florida home. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s luxury resort in Palm Beach, Florida, has been affectionately dubbed the ‚ÄoeWinter White House,‚Äù and the president has spent a considerable amount of time there since taking office, even hosting other world leaders on the spectacular grounds. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a very good thing that none of these foreign dignitaries were there on Monday because a sinkhole opened up just in front of the property. ‚ÄoeA sinkhole near Mar-a-Lago has closed a lane of traffic as crews work the scene,‚Äù CBS 12 reports, adding, ‚ÄoeThe sinkhole is along the Southern Blvd side of the exclusive club.‚Äù Of course, the left decided to use the opportunity to crack a few jokes on Twitter. Actions have consequences, people. ‚Ä" Slade Sohmer () May 22, 2017 A sinkhole just opened in front of President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Mar-a-Lago estate THE ORB DEMANDS SACRIFICE ‚Ä" Oliver Willis () May 22, 2017 The swamp is draining? ‚Ä" Peter Stevenson () May 22, 2017 According to WFTV, the 4-foot by 4-foot sinkhole is just west of Mar-a-Lago‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s southern entrance, near a new water main.

While in Israel, Trump became the very first sitting U.S. president to visit the Western Wall, a Jewish holy site. The Trumps and their entourage, including Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, will depart Israel on Tuesday en route to Rome, where the president will meet with Pope Francis on Wednesday at The Vatican before touring St. Peter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Basilica. From there, he will head to the Quirinal Palace in Rome, the official residence of President Sergio Mattarella of Italy, before arriving in Brussels sometime in the late afternoon to meet with King Philippe of Belgium. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s schedule is packed during his overseas trip, so he has absolutely no time whatsoever for a small sinkhole outside of his Florida property. Luckily, it appears the issue is being handled and will undoubtedly be fixed by the time he returns.
