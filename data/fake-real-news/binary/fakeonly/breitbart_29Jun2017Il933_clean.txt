Students are now required to submit an ‚Äoeemotional risk‚Äù level for guest speaker events that they wish to host on campus. The options on the university‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s online portal, Gatorhub, include ‚ÄoeSensitive Subject Matter,‚Äù ‚ÄoeReaction of Participants,‚Äù and ‚ÄoePotential Controversy.‚Äù The new policy likely comes in response to the increased efforts by college students across the country to censor guest speakers, which have overwhelmingly been of conservative and libertarian ideological persuasion. The new policy asks event organizers to estimate the ‚Äoeemotional risk‚Äù level associated with their event, but they are able to skip the question. Student responses that are recorded are used by administrators to determine event staffing needs. Emily Jashinsky of the Washington Examiner argues that University of Florida students should skip the question entirely, calling it ‚Äoean example of how universities condition students to cope with challenges.‚Äù Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.
