Jenna Jameson, the ex-porn star who turned her life around and converted to Judaism, is pretty hard hitting when it comes to Islamic terrorism. Jameson, whose husband is a devout Jew, still gets idiots making remarks to her about all kinds of things. When one Muslim journalist made known a ridiculous ‚ÄoeIslamic State fantasy,‚Äù Jameson jumped on that right away and crushed his stupidity. She gave him a reality check, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s something he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll never forget. The big question that journalists and foreign policy experts are discussing is ‚Äoehow to stop Islamic terrorism?‚Äù It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s on cable news 24/7 after the many terrorist‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attacks in recent days. Jenna Jameson takes her Jewish faith extremely seriously, and she fears for the lives of her children as they spend a lot of time in Israel. So, when a Muslim journalist named Medhi Hasan tweeted to her his ridiculous ISIS fantasy on how to stop terrorism, Jameson crushed him, making him look like a fool. There is, by definition, only one way to really defeat terrorism. To refuse to be terrorized.#London ‚Ä" Mehdi Hasan () June 4, 2017 I suggest killing them‚Ä¶ ‚Ä" Jenna Jameson () June 6, 2017 ‚ÄoeHow hard do you think terrorists laugh at people who think the only way to stop them is by refusing to be scared of them? Seriously, this hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exactly worked out so hot over the past two decades; no matter how many people refuse to be fearful, the terrorists keep on killing innocents,‚Äù reported Twitchy in response to Hasan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ridiculous liberal fantasy. That brings up similar sentiments from radio host Michael Savage, who is also Jewish, and Nigel Farage, who is the famous ‚ÄoeBrexit‚Äù guy who helped Donald Trump win the election. Savage and Farage are under fire for suggesting doing something drastic with the would-be terrorists who are on law enforcement ‚Äoewatch lists‚Äù since we know that a few Islamic thugs who carried out terror attacks have been on those watch lists. Savage and Farage both want to round up all those suspected of possible terrorist activities and throw them in internment camps like we did during World War II. Of course, the liberals snowflakes are melting over this kind of talk, but is it so crazy? Maybe not; maybe we have reached the point of no return and it would work to thwart most attacks. ‚ÄoeHe [Farage] told Fox News, of which he is a contributor, that World War II-style internment camps could be the answer to clamping down on radicalization,‚Äù New York Post reports. Farage said, ‚ÄoeWe could take the 3,500 who are the genuinely suspected terrorists themselves ‚Ä" as opposed to being linked and associated ‚Ä" we could round them all up and intern them in prison.‚Äù Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t confuse internment camps with death camps. The United States held Japanese in internment camps right here on US soil during World War II. We found up to 800 spies sending intel back to the Japanese that way. War is hard and war is brutal, and people need to understand, we are at war with ISIS. Do you support Katie Hopkins and Nigel Farage in their calls for internment camps for muslims? ‚Ä" Thomas Paine () June 5, 2017 Last week, Mike Savage hosted . Today, he called for "WWII-style internment camps" following the London attack. ‚Ä" Matthew Gertz () June 5, 2017 As for Michael Savage, he got placed on the Southern Poverty Law Center list as a racist for his statements. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry, everyone who identifies as conservative is on that list, including conservative Catholic priests and conservative Protestant ministers. Savage said, ‚ÄoeNow, I said the same thing last week. Why are we going soft on Islamists when they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going hard on the West? I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m asking you a question. How much longer are we going to tolerate them killing us and killing our children?‚Äù Savage answers his own question, saying, ‚ÄoeWell, what is the answer? Well, one London politician, one politician from England [Farage] said we have to put them in camps immediately, and of course, CNN wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go for that. British politician says suspected terrorists should be put in camps. Now that will get all of the good liberals in New York very frightened.‚Äù Savage went on to agree with Farage while admitting that there were many innocent people who got caught up and sent to internment camps during World War II. But, especially for England, what would you want the government to do? Whatever they are doing isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t working. Is this the reality check the radical Islamists need? Desperate times call for desperate measures, and America must come first ‚Ä" so many civilian deaths, when is enough enough? Only you can answer that question for yourself.
