Rigoberto Lopez-Martinez, a 26-year-old convicted sex offender from Mexico, and Jose Luis Flores-Valles, a 34-year-old sex offender, were arrested in separate incidents after crossing through from Mexico, U.S. Border Patrol officials said in a release. Agents with the Ajo Border Patrol Stations arrested Martinez after he allegedly jumped the border in the desert. Martinez was deported in 2012 after he was convicted of rape in Idaho. Agents at the Three Points Substation arrested Valles after he re-entered the U.S. Following his arrest, agents found that he had been removed in 2007 for sex crimes against a minor in Colorado. He was subsequently listed in the federal sex offender registry. U.S. Border Patrol officials said Martinez and Valles will now both be held in immigration detention and are facing felony charges for re-entering the U.S. Due to the southern border‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s vulnerabilities, sex offenders often cross back into the U.S. In April, an illegal immigrant sex offender was arrested in Texas after being deported six days prior, Breitbart Texas reported.
