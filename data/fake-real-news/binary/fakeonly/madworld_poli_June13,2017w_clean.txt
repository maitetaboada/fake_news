Former Fox News diva Megyn Kelly received a rude awakening this morning that she wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expecting as news of her firing hit the headlines. Now, the Trump-hating news anchor has six solemn words to describe being canned, and honestly, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hard to feel bad for her. According to Daily Mail, Megyn Kelly received word of her firing from the Sandy Hook Promises Gala on Monday, June 12, 2017. Kelly was originally hired as the official host of the event that is to take place on Wednesday, June 14, 2017, in Washington, D.C. The decision to can Kelly came after she interviewed InfoWars host Alex Jones, who is a staunch denier of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which occurred on December 14, 2012, in Newtown, Connecticut, when 20-year-old Adam Lanza fatally shot 20 children between six and seven years old, as well as six adult staff members. Kelly had reportedly planned to use part of the taping from the Sandy Hook Promises Gala on her show alongside a segment from her Alex Jones interview. This plan fell apart quickly for the liberal news anchor as she got word of her dismissal from the event. Things quickly got worse for Kelly as one major advertiser, JP Morgan Chase, pulled their ad from her show when the head of marketing commented on Twitter that she was ‚Äoerepulsed‚Äù by the interview. ‚ÄoeAs an advertiser, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m repulsed that would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why?‚Äù JP Morgan Chase Chief Marketing Officer Kristin Lemkau said. In an effort to conduct some major damage control, Kelly released a statement about her firing. ‚ÄoeI understand and respect the decision of the event organizers, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m of course disappointed that I won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be there to support them on Wednesday night,‚Äù began Kelly in her statement ‚ÄoeI find Alex Jones‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> suggestion that Sandy Hook was ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>a hoax‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> as personally revolting as every other rational person does.‚Äù What Kelly did next in her statement was all too predictable. She found a way to bash President Donald Trump for the consequences of her own stupid decisions. ‚ÄoeIt left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview. How does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the President of the United States and a growing audience of millions?‚Äù Kelly said. ‚ÄoePresident Trump, by praising and citing him, appearing on his show, and giving him White House press credentials, has helped elevate Jones, to the alarm of many,‚Äù she added. What a loser. Eventually, Kelly will figure out that people see past her plastic stare and pretenses. Many, like myself, cannot wait to see Kelly‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s career as a whole end up in the dumpster. After this huge mistake, it shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take long for Kelly‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own liberal colleagues to eat her alive and more advertisers to drop her like a bad habit.
