He is asolutely right. ‚Ä" Forward to Happiness () June 28, 2017 Thanks, Martin Sheen 8 ‚Ä" Andrea Drusch () June 28, 2017 The Sheen-featured fundraising email comes as the national Democratic Party posted its worst May of fundraising since 2003, raising just $4.29 million. The Republican National Committee, however, raised a record $10.8 million in May. For Sheen, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hardly his first time attacking Trump. During the presidential election, the actor said then-candidate Trump was ‚Äoean empty-headed moron‚Äù that had ‚Äoeabsolutely nothing to offer‚Äù American voters and had ‚Äoeno chance‚Äù at winning the White House in November. The actor also appeared in an anti-Trump campaign ad after the election that sought to get members of the Electoral College to switch their votes to former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
