According to the poll, only 29 percent of respondents say the baker should be prosecuted for discrimination, while 14 percent are undecided. The survey of 1,000 likely voters was conducted on June 26-27, 2017. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95 percent level of confidence. The poll‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s results are revealed as the U.S. Supreme Court has announced it will hear the case of bakery owner Jack Phillips, who, due to his religious beliefs, would not provide a wedding cake in 2012 for David Mullins and Charlie Craig, who said they were marrying in Massachusetts. Phillips told the men he would gladly provide other baked goods for them but could not make a cake that promotes a same-sex wedding ceremony.

Attempting to restrict religious conviction to the four walls of a church is not freedom, that is tyranny.‚Äù
