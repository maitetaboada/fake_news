President Donald Trump is facing the worst crisis of his presidency, and he has just discovered that it all leads back to evil billionaire George Soros. For weeks, we have heard the Democrats and Trump-hating media call for his impeachment over bogus allegations about Russia. Now, Trump has discovered the real threat as Soros plots a violent revolution in to overthrow him, and patriotic Americans are ready to defend our duly elected president. George Soros backed major revolutions, called color revolutions, all over Europe in the 1990s, and now, he has set his sites on the United States. Crazy, right? Well, before you dismiss it as a nutty conspiracy, you need to look further into everything that has been going on behind the scenes with Soros, the Democratic National Committee, and Ukraine. With Soros as the moneyman and mastermind, the moving pieces in this plot are a DNC operative named Alexandra Chalupa, who is an activist of Ukrainian heritage, and convicted ‚ÄoeSpeedway Bomber‚Äù Brett Kimberlin, who is also a Ukrainian operative. Chalupa and Kimberlin are Soros agents working to undermine Trump by ratcheting up the mainstream media and liberal loons into a frenzy, making them think Trump should be impeached by any means. Kimberlin is such a shady character, as Daily Caller reported, ‚ÄoeKimberlin earned the nickname ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Speedway Bomber‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> by being convicted of setting a string of bombs in Speedway, Indiana in 1978.‚Äù Meet Soros-Funded Domestic Terrorist Brett Kimberlin Whose ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Job‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Is Terrorizing Bloggers Into Silence ‚Ä" TheBlaze d ‚Ä" Lee Stranahan () May 28, 2017 ‚ÄoeChalupa told Politico she had developed a network of sources in Kiev and Washington, including investigative journalists, government officials, and private intelligence operatives. She said that, when Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s unlikely presidential campaign began surging in late 2015, she began focusing more on the research, and expanded it to include Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ties to Russia, as well,‚Äù Politico reports. Chalupa admits, way back in late 2015, she started looking for a Trump-Russia connection. Why? Because that is what Soros was paying her to do. Soros‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> masterplan is to link Trump to Russia, make it appear as if the election was somehow interfered with, and then to do what he did in Ukraine, foment the useful idiots to take to the streets and start a violent revolution to overthrow Trump. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re calling it the ‚ÄoePurple Revolution.‚Äù ‚ÄoeNo sooner had Trump been declared the 45th President of the United States, Soros-funded political operations launched their activities to disrupt Trump during Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lame-duck period and thereafter. The swiftness of the Purple Revolution is reminiscent of the speed at which protesters hit the streets of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, in two Orange Revolutions sponsored by Soros,‚Äù reports Zero Hedge. Turns out it was the Ukranians not the Russians who interfered in our democracy. ‚Ä" queenofJugoslavia () May 28, 2017 But, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all a lie, right? Trump did not collude with Russia. Yes, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s true, but that doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter; what matters is what people believe. Ukraine is important here, as most of you know, because they are Russia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mortal enemies, and they should be. We don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have space here to go into a history lesson about why Ukrainians hate Russia, so just know that is why Soros enlisted the help of those loyal to Ukrainians (Chalupa and Kimberlin) along with the leaders of Ukraine to help start this revolution. This is just the tip of the iceberg of a very complex story that has many layers, but one thing is very strange when it comes to Chalupa‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sister Andrea, who works with her. She posted a tweet in December 2016 about Seth Rich, implying he had ‚Äoeregrets.‚Äù Remember, Rich was the DNC staffer who many think leaked the DNC emails to WikiLeaks, so why would Andrea Chalupa make a public comment as if she knows what Rich did and that, in her sick estimation, he should regret it? This tweet by her sister creeps me out. 9Uc ‚Ä" Megs () May 28, 2017 Trump is aware of what is going on. He realizes the leaks are not coming from his White House as much as they are being fabricated by Soros agents like Chalupa and Kimberlin who leak fake news to the liberal media. He also knows these saboteurs won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop until they are obliterated. It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media. ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 28, 2017 Ooh. Things getting hot. May not need fireworks,at all this summer. HERE WE GO! ‚Ä" bill.of.rights.lady () May 29, 2017 Patriots won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stand by and allow Soros to win as he did in Europe. In fact, many are answering the call by pledging to stop those Antifa idiots who are planning to start this Purple Revolution this summer. All we want is to make America great again; we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to relive the Revolutionary War. We pray for the best and will expect the worst. Godspeed to all freedom loving Americans.
