President Donald Trump is on a roll, calling out all the Democrats who are continually conjuring up ridiculous allegations about Russia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ties to him and his administration. Trump just learned shocking new information that destroys Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lies for good, proving they are full of crap as he gets the last laugh on all Democrats. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to love this. The mainstream media and the Democrats have been shoving their conspiracy theory about Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign and Russia somehow colluding to win the election. Nevermind that there is no evidence to support these bogus claims, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s something that Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi have made their special crusade. Waters is probably the worst offender with Pelosi a close second. Waters showed her ignorance two days ago on MSNBC, saying, ‚ÄoeI think this president should be impeached. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care what others say that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s too soon, that we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what to think. I think we are letting the American people down about this Jared Kushner and this backchanneling and the lies, failure to disclose, [Jeff] Sessions failure to disclose, what more do we need?‚Äù Well, we need proof of a crime to prosecute citizens in the United States. ‚ÄoeBackchanneling‚Äù is exactly what all countries do to contact their counterparts for diplomacy; it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a necessity to run a government. So far, Maxine has never spoken about any real crimes, but don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t tell her that because she may have a mental breakdown. Waters also wanted to know about a low-level campaign adviser to Trump named Carter Page, who she says is in the ‚ÄoeKremlin Klan.‚Äù This point will become quite interesting, as you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll see. Flynn, Sessions, Now ‚Ä"> Former Trump adviser Carter Page also met with Russian envoy #KremlinKlan #HConRes15 ‚Ä" Maxine Waters () March 3, 2017 Pelosi is also crazy with Russia fever, saying Trump needs to stick to facts. ‚ÄoeWhat do the Russians have on Donald Trump personally, politically, financially?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄoeHopefully, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll understand that data, facts matter.‚Äù Well, it looks like Waters and Pelosi, who are the loudest and most ignorant Democratic duo screeching about Trump, got a rude awakening today when the president shut them up, and now, they look like fools. It seems the Democrats don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want anything to do with Carter Page, who was set to testify on Capitol Hill. Yep, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the same Carter Page who Maxine Waters claimed was in the ‚ÄoeKremlin Klan.‚Äù ‚ÄoeCongressional Democrats are delaying the testimony of an ex-Trump adviser Carter Page caught up in the Russia probe in an attempt to prevent him from pushing back on ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>false or misleading testimony‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> by Obama-era spy chiefs,‚Äù reports Fox News. What could have happened that the Democrats don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want Carter Page to testify? Page, who had really nothing to do with Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign and never met with Trump, according to Corey Lewandowski, does have one thing the Democrats are terrified of ‚Ä" he most likely was part of a FISA warrant that Barack Obama illegally obtained to spy on Trump Tower. So now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don't want him to testify. He blows away their‚Ä¶. ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 31, 2017 ‚Ä¶case against him & now wants to clear his name by showing "the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan‚Ä¶" Witch Hunt! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 31, 2017 Trump sums up Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s constant lies on their Trump-Russia conspiracy with two words, ‚ÄoeWitch Hunt.‚Äù He also calls out James Comey and John Brennan as liars when it comes to Carter Page. What happened to Nancy Pelosi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s line about sticking to facts and data? I guess when those facts prove you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re a damn liar you call off the testimony of Carter Page, the man who will go on the record and show the world everything on Russia has been a lie from the very beginning. President Trump just destroyed those Democratic losers. When will they learn their fantasy about impeaching Trump is about as likely as their idol Barack Obama ever being president again ‚Ä" it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just not going to happen, ever. Americans are sick and tired of their idiotic schemes. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s high time all those politicians not doing their jobs get voted in November 2018. Keep draining the swamp until the last rat is gone for good.
