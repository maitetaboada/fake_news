SAN FRANCISCO ‚Ä" After months of upheaval within the company, Travis Kalanick has stepped down as the CEO of Uber and will be replaced by a tired foreign student who has to pick up a few extra hours if he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to make rent this month. ‚ÄoeNormally I wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do this sort of thing,‚Äù said Kalim Mahfouz in his first statement as the new head of the $68 billion ride-sharing company. ‚ÄoeBut they cut back on my hours at the library.‚Äù The scandal-ridden company will give Kalanick a multi-million dollar buyout. Critics have been quick to point out that this is far less than the $5 an hour Uber plans to pay Mahfouz. ‚ÄoeIt seems like it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s less than minimum wage but we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re allowed to do it since Kalim won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t technically be CEO,‚Äù said Uber spokesperson Mary Powers. ‚ÄoeHe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be part of the new ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>executive-sharing‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> economy, which disrupts outdated ideas like minimum wage. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s also why we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to give him health benefits.‚Äù Mahfouz, who does most of his chief executive work after 2am and before his 8am economics lecture, says that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s happy for the opportunity to be a part of the Uber team. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve already learned a lot,‚Äù say Mahfouz, between gulps of coffee. ‚ÄoeSpecifically, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve learned that if you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t budget your money you might end up in charge of a ride-share app.‚Äù At press time, Uber‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s board of directors had used a promo code to make Mahfouz‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s first week free.
