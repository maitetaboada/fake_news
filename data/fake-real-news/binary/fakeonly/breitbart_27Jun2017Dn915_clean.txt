While speaking at a meeting of Republican Senators on Tuesday, President Trump stated that Obamacare can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be the American healthcare system, but ‚Äoeif we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get it done, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just going to be something that we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not going to like, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s okay, and I understand that very well.‚Äù Trump said Obamacare is ‚Äoemelting down‚Äù ‚Äoeand we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to try and solve the problem. ‚Ä¶ So, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to talk, and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to see what we can do. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re getting very close. But for the country, we have to have health care, and it can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be Obamacare, which is melting down. The other side is saying all sorts of things before they even knew what the bill was. This will be great if we get it done, and if we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get it done, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just going to be something that we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not going to like, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s okay, and I understand that very well. But I think we have a chance to do something very, very important for the public, very, very important for the people of our country that we love.‚Äù Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter
