Wednesday on CNN‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚ÄoeNew Day,‚Äù while discussing the Senate GOP‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s heath care bill with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), an opponent of the bill, host Chris Cuomo decried the ‚Äoefake thing‚Äù when Johnson said that numbers being used to attack the Republican effort were ‚Äoeincorrect.‚Äù Johnson said,‚ÄoeWe need information, and the debate on this thing has been completely distorted using incorrect information.‚Äù Cuomo shot back, ‚ÄoeI know you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not suggesting that I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m using misleading information, right? You let me know what I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m saying that is inaccurate. Because this whole ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>fake‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> thing needs to end, and it needs to end right now! You tell me what I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m getting wrong, or we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll deal with the number as the CBO is putting them out.‚Äù Follow Pam Key on Twitter
