The remarks by Nadav Argaman are a rare admission of Israelâ€<sup>TM</sup>s use of offensive cyber capabilities. Argaman spoke at a cyber defense conference in Tel Aviv on Tuesday. He says that â€oepassive defenseâ€ is not enough, and that the Shin Bet studied hackersâ€<sup>TM</sup> strategies and developed â€oea variety of ways and methodsâ€ on how to strike back. Israeli cyber officials are ordinarily reluctant to discuss the use of offensive capabilities against hackers.
