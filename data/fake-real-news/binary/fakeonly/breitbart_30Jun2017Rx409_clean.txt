Lawmakers voted 393 for legalising ‚Äoemarriage for everybody‚Äù and 226 against, with four abstentions. Merkel said Monday that lawmakers could take up the issue as a ‚Äoequestion of conscience,‚Äù allowing members of her conservative coalition, which has been against same-sex marriage, to individually vote for it.

Many applauded Merkel‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s comments that opened the way for the vote, but Social Democrat lawmaker Johannes Kahrs noted in the debate that the chancellor had been a longtime opponent of gay marriage. ‚ÄoeMany thanks for nothing,‚Äù he said bluntly. Germany has allowed same-sex couples to enter civil partnerships since 2001, but has not granted them full marital rights, which include the possibility to jointly adopt children. The new law won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take effect for several months because it still needs to pass the upper house of Parliament and be approved by the president, though those are formalities. It is also expected to face legal challenges. Merkel told reporters after the vote that her vote against the measure was based upon her reading of the country‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s law concerning marriage and that she did think gay couples should be able to adopt. Germany‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s basic law is vague, saying only that ‚Äoemarriage and the family shall enjoy the protection of the state,‚Äù but Merkel said that for her ‚Äoemarriage as defined by the law is the marriage of a man and a woman.‚Äù She added, however, that she stood by her contention that the interpretation was a ‚Äoequestion of conscience‚Äù and urged all views to be respected. ‚ÄoeIt was a long, intensive, and for many also emotional discussion, that goes for me personally too, and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m hopeful not only that there will be respect for either side‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s opinions, but that it will also bring about more peace and cohesion in society,‚Äù she said. All of Merkel‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s potential coalition partners after the September election, including the center-left Social Democrats of her challenger, Martin Schulz, have been calling for same-sex marriage to be legalized. It is not clear whether Merkel thought her Monday comments would prompt such a quick vote, but many analysts have suggested that by opening the door to gay marriage the chancellor removed yet another issue that might have helped her opponents in their campaigns against her. In nearly 12 years as chancellor, Merkel has moved her party to the center and away from conservative orthodoxy, speeding up Germany‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exit from nuclear power and ending military conscription among other moves. ___ Frank Jordans contributed to this report.
