Unbelievable. It turns out that picking a fight with one of the most powerful and beloved institutions in the world might finally be the thing that brings down Donald Trump. ‚ÄoeAs a nationalist, I believe in getting a good deal,‚Äù said disillusioned Trump voter Robin Teslin. ‚ÄoeBut as an American, I have to take a stand against anything that threatens the flow of rich creamy milk into our great land.‚Äù Even staunchly pro-Trump sources like Breitbart and InfoWars have released searing editorials, scourging the President‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s flippant attitude toward the honest, rough-handed men and women who grasp the teats of the North. ‚ÄoeWe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve predicted Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s downfall many times before, but this must finally be it,‚Äù said New York Times correspondent Will Abdulla, clutching close to his body the precious bags of 3.5% which every American hoards and treasures. ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s widely accepted that a thick, frosty glass of Ontario milk is the last area of bipartisan consensus.‚Äù This milk feud comes at a bad time for Trump, who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s already facing criticism for going after another universally cherished institution, softwood lumber. ‚ÄoeDonald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s stance on milk protectionism is a slap in the face to the decent folks who just want to come home after a long workday and enjoy a well-deserved 28-oz glass of Oshawa skim,‚Äù said Kellyanne Conway, sipping half-and-half from a chardonnay glass. ‚ÄoeEven I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t put a good spin on that.‚Äù Looks like there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no coming back from this, and rumours are circulating that Trump plans to step down. ‚ÄoeThis is where Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s political inexperience really begins to show,‚Äù said Presidential historian Graham Howitzer. ‚ÄoeYou don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mess with big milk. Kennedy learned that the hard way.‚Äù Tags: Breitbart, Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway, Kennedy, Milk, New York Times, Oshawa, softwood lumber
