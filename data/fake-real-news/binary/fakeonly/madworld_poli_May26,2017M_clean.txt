It is not a good day for welfare rats all across America as they just received some horrible news, for them at least. As it turns out, President Donald Trump just dropped a massive bomb ‚Ä" and now, each and every one of them is in a frenzy as they try to figure out what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s next. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no arguing that the last 8 years has been detrimental to American society. Not only have we seen a massive divide in our country, but taxpayers have been forced to watch as more and more people become dependent on the government. Of course, this is a time-old tactic of Democrats as they continue to buy votes in a way that is not only legal but effective. In short, they get people dependent on the government ‚Ä" a notion which the right does not agree with ‚Ä" all the while telling those same people that if they want the money to continue, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll have to vote blue. As a result, former President Barack Obama was able to balloon welfare and other various ‚Äoeentitlement‚Äù programs to levels not seen for quite some time. Unfortunately for Democrats, this plan didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t work as President Donald Trump was still elected despite their best efforts. This news was disastrous for the left twofold. They not only have to face a Republican president in the Oval Office but also a GOP-controlled House and Senate. Additionally, Trump is now doing away with their covert vote stealing agenda. According to The Political Insider, ‚ÄoePresident Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s latest budget includes provisions that will require able-bodied people to actually work in order to receive welfare.‚Äù The work requirement in the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 2018 budget will save a whopping $190 billion over the next ten years, according to the Office of Management and Budget, and is part of a larger plan to reform welfare in America. ‚ÄoeWe must reform our welfare system so that it does not discourage able-bodied adults from working, which takes away scarce resources from those in real need. Work must be the center of our social policy,‚Äù the president wrote in his letter to Congress accompanying his proposed budget. His budget director, Mick Mulvaney, made clear at a press conference this week that people need to get a job to be eligible for food stamps going forward, saying: ‚ÄoeIf you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re on food stamps and you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re able-bodied, then we need you to go to work.‚Äù [Source: LifeZette] The fact of the matter here is that no one is entitled to anything ‚Ä" unless you earn it. We, as a society, should take care of those who are physically unable to care for themselves but that doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t include those who are just too lazy to get off the couch and go to work. Sadly, this is the mindset that the left has been trying to ingrain in members of society in order to enslave them to their Democrat masters, but it is a recipe for disaster that will only result in too many dependent people and not enough working Americans to support them. Fortunately, we now have a leader who doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mind hurting a few feelings to get things done. In the end, if you want something in this life, you better be willing to get off your butt and go to work for it like the rest of us.
