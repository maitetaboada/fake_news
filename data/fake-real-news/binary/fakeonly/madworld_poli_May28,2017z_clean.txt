A few hours into his shift, a Michigan chef was more than delighted to get a compliment on his cooking. However, things would take a shocking turn as he went out to talk to the customer ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s when he was left horrified to see who had just finished eating at the bar. The incident took place at Sava‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Restaurant in St. Ann Arbor, where employees were hard at work. As Chicago Tribune reports, two men had come in and ordered some breakfast, but these weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t your average customers. After one ate waffles and bacon and the other had eggs and toast, staff in the back were told that someone liked the food so much that they wanted to personally deliver a compliment to the chef, according to Weasel Zippers. The two patrons, who had just finished eating and were eager to give the staff a compliment, were ready to get back to work, and since they were actually Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to go far to find the nearest illegal alien. As it turns out, the law enforcement personnel were actually conducting what is known as ‚Äoea targeted enforcement action.‚Äù After hearing that the business may have been illegally employing illegal aliens, they decided to swing down to check things out. Of course, they figured that, while they were there, they might as well have the illegal aliens cook them a nice breakfast before taking them into custody ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly what they did. Although a few tried to get away, the agents were able to detain four men in total. After one showed the agents his permanent resident card, he was released, but the other three are reportedly still in custody. According to ICE, two of the men entered the country illegally and another overstayed his visa. Of course, those on the left have expressed disgust in how the agents decided to detain the men, but that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the case for everyone. In fact, some people have expressed the exact opposite. Furthermore, many are wondering if the owner of the restaurant is going to face consequences for hiring these men. Come to find out, the restaurant is just one of three owned by Sava Lelcaj ‚Ä" an immigrant herself. Although she herself lived in the U.S. illegally, she has most recently become a citizen and now owns and operates her own businesses here in America. Of course, she states that her company vets employees to determine their eligibility and that she had believed the men in question were in the country legally ‚Ä" but not everyone is so sure. When it comes down to it, ignorance isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t an excuse, and Lelcaj should have been more diligent in her research. Breaking the law warrants consequences ‚Ä" it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s that simple. You either violated the rules or you didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t, and this woman most certainly did. For that, she deserves to be punished in hopes of showing everyone else that such behavior will not be tolerated. Law and order are finally being restored in our nation, and as long as President Donald Trump is in office, those who violate our nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s laws will be held accountable.
