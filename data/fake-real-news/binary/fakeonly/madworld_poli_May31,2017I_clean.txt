Kathy Griffin just about broke the Internet yesterday after a photo of herself with what appeared to be the decapitated head of President Donald Trump surfaced online. Unfortunately for her, things didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go exactly how she planned as she received a horrifying surprise she wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expecting ‚Ä" and her pathetic apology wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t enough to stop what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s coming next. Although the liberal comedian may pretend otherwise, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no arguing that Griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s career has been headed down the toilet. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why she felt the need to strip naked time and time again for the sake of publicity, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why she decided to stage a mock beheading of the President of the United States. In a desperate attempt to resuscitate her fleeting career, Griffin knew that the image depicting her holding Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bloody head would make waves and get her attention, but she wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t prepared for the backlash she was about to suffer. Within a few short moments of the image going viral, Griffin released a pathetic Facebook apology (not to Trump), but it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t enough to stop the real consequences coming her way.

I went too far. I was wrong. Posted by Kathy Griffin on Tuesday, May 30, 2017 According to Breaking 911, Secret Service has most recently announced that they are ‚Äoeon it‚Äù when it comes to seeing the growing threat that was spreading around social media. After all, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no arguing that the image could be used to incite violence, meaning that Griffin is now an enemy of the state. On it! has a robust protective intelligence division that monitors open source reporting & social media to evaluate threats ‚Ä" U.S. Secret Service () May 30, 2017 Threats made against protectees receive the highest priority of all of our investigations. #ProtectionNeverRests ‚Ä" U.S. Secret Service () May 30, 2017 Too bad for Griffin there are other consequences she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s facing right now as liberals seem to be turning their backs on her. Breitbart states that Anderson Cooper, among other famed liberals, has stepped forward to call her antics ‚Äoeappalling‚Äù and ‚Äoedisgusting‚Äù ‚Ä" but that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the worst of it, for her, at least. For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate. ‚Ä" Anderson Cooper () May 31, 2017 You know how we mentioned that her career was struggling? Well, it just got a whole lot worse as the people who once paid her can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get away from her quickly enough. For one, Breitbart reports that ‚ÄoeCNN is evaluating Kathy Griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s role in its annual New Year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Eve coverage after the comedian posed for a photo shoot holding a decapitated, bloody head resembling that of President Donald Trump.‚Äù ‚ÄoeWe found what she did disgusting and offensive,‚Äù CNN said in a statement Tuesday, according to Mediaite. ‚ÄoeWe are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down. We are evaluating our New Year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Eve coverage and have made no decisions at this point.‚Äù Furthermore, TruthFeed reports that she was fired by Squatty Potty, a brand which she was currently promoting. ‚ÄoeWe were shocked and disappointed to learn about the image Ms. Griffin shared today, it was deeply inappropriate and runs contrary to the core values our company stands for,‚Äù CEO Bobby Edwards said in a statement. ‚ÄoeIn response, Squatty Potty has suspended its ad campaign featuring Ms. Griffin.‚Äù We have pulled all marketing related to Kathy Griffin, we do not align with her views or actions. ‚Ä" Squatty Potty¬Æ () May 31, 2017 Griffin is not having a good time just a few hours after releasing a photo meant to strum up publicity, which she got, just not how she had hoped. This wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t about First Amendment rights, this was about a selfish liberal trying desperately to save her pathetically failing career by drumming up a little attention in a way that she could brush off as ‚Äoefunny‚Äù or ‚Äoeart.‚Äù Too bad for her, it just blew up in her face, and it couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have happened more spectacularly. Not only is she an enemy of the state, but the few people who were actually still paying her are now backing away one by one, and I think it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s safe to say that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not laughing now, much like the audience at one of her comedy routines.
