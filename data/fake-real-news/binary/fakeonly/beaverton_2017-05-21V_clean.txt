OTTAWA ‚Ä" In a new marketing campaign, chain restaurant The Pickle Barrel is appealing directly to a historically undervalued consumer base: people who steal individually packaged jams. ‚ÄoePeople who steal jam are people too. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time we recognize that‚Äù, said Pickle Barrel CEO Jenny O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Brien. ‚ÄoeCompeting directly with jam juggernaut The Golden Griddle hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t been easy, but we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve had great success by offering larger varieties of jam available for theft‚Äù Flavours available to would be preserve bandits include raspberry, strawberry, grape and marmalade. ‚ÄoeThat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s like European jam‚Äù, O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Brien explained while proudly unveiling Pickle Barrel‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s new rotating table-top jam trolley ‚Ä" the Rolls Royce of personal sized jam dispensers. Unlike other breakfast restaurant chains, Pickle Barrel customers will no longer have to sneak behind an unattended server station to steal the adorably sized packaged jams. ‚ÄoeHave you seen those table top trolleys? I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help myself‚Äù, admitted an anonymous jam thief in hushed tones, ‚ÄoeI get a rush every time I put 4 or 5 in my purse. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even use them.‚Äù Another customer divulged his secret for moving larger quantities of the stolen jam, ‚ÄoeCargo pants. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m saying‚Äù. In an effort to further boost market share Pickle Barrel is also expected to launch a new advertising campaign this summer entitled ‚Äoeour salt and pepper shakers would look great in your kitchen.‚Äù Tags: cargo pants, Golden Griddle, jam, Pickle Barrel, stealing, theft
