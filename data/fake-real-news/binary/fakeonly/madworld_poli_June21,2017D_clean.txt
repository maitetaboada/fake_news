A social justice warrior was in for a bit more than she bargained after appearing on Tucker Carlson‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s show and mocking white people. Although viewers initially humiliated her on social media, that was nothing in comparison to what was barreling down the track ‚Ä" and now, days later, she just learned a brutal lesson that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll likely never forget. You may remember a certain racist making her way onto Fox News recently with an ignorant message that she decided to unleash on live television. In fact, not too many people were expecting what Lisa Durden, a professor at Essex County College in Newark, New Jersey, was about to say about the Memorial Day holiday. As it turns out, Tucker and Durden were talking about the plans one group had to segregate Memorial Day celebrations by only allowing black people to attend. Without a moment‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s notice, the SJW punk looked into the camera and began to mock white people everywhere. ‚ÄoeWhat I say to that is boo-hoo-hoo, you white people are angry because you couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t use your ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>white privilege‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> card to get invited to the Black Lives Matter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all-black Memorial Day celebration,‚Äù she said at the time. As one would imagine, Americans all across the country weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t happy with the remarks and the fact that Fox News would allow such a blatant racist on their network. Although Durden caught a little heat on social media, it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t long before things naturally died down. However, things certainly weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t over. In fact, it just got a whole lot worse as she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s since been forced to experience a brutal lesson. According to The Gateway Pundit, Durden has most recently ‚Äoebeen suspended from her teaching position for her racist comments mocking white people on Fox News.‚Äù However, it seems that the entitled brat still isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t getting the point and is trying to play the victim. Lisa Durden was told that she had to cancel her classes and report to Essex County College‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s human resources department two days after a June 6 appearance on the prime time Fox News show. School officials then indefinitely suspended her. ‚ÄoeThey did this to humiliate me,‚Äù Durden told The Star-Ledger. ‚ÄoeEssex County College publicly lynched me in front of my students.‚Äù [Source: The Daily Caller] Of course, not many people have any sympathy for Durden as she brought this upon herself. In fact, it seems that gloating on social media, pertaining to the instant justice she received, has been so harsh and so severe that she temporarily disabled her account. If ever there was a phrase that bothered me, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoereverse racism‚Äù because there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no such thing. There is just racism. As defined, racism is simply ‚Äoeprejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own race is superior.‚Äù That doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mention anyone by skin color in particular because it applies to everyone, regardless of race. To use a term like ‚Äoereverse racism‚Äù implies that it takes substantially more for a person of color to be racist as opposed to whites ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just not true. In fact, Durden just proved herself to be as racist as anyone can be, and now, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rightfully paying for it.
