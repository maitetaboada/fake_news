President Donald Trump has been under fire for his strong stance on wiping out the Islamic State, and he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been at odds with London‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Muslim Mayor Sadiq Khan, one of Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s good buddies, who tried to embarrass Trump after the London terror attack. The liberal press was cheering Khan big time, but Trump turned that cheering into dead silence with a nasty surprise for Khan that left him and his loser liberal sycophants speechless. Sadiq Khan hates Donald Trump for his strong stance on Muslim migrants. As mayor of London, he openly supported Hillary Clinton, and he also wanted Trump banned from entering England. Khan is a Muslim activist of the worst kind, a man who has wanted to flood England with Muslim migrants. He is nothing more than a weak-kneed politician who said back in February that ‚ÄoeDonald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s visit to the UK should be canceled over his cruel and shameful policies,‚Äù reported Express. President Trump's ban on refugees and immigrants from certain countries is shameful and cruel. ‚Ä" Sadiq Khan () January 29, 2017 So, last night when London, the city Khan is charged with protecting, was hit by a heinous Islamic terror attack, Khan said, ‚ÄoeThere is no reason to be alarmed, law enforcement have it under control.‚Äù Well, that didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sit right with Trump who has had to listen to Khan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bullcrap attacks on his Muslim travel ban policy. On a March 2nd radio show, Khan, a devout Muslim, even called Trump a racist and said that those who support him are just as bad. After calling the Brexit movement ‚Äoeracist,‚Äù Khan again put Trump into that category, saying, ‚ÄoeYou can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t escape the fact, over the last two years, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve had these events, Brexit, President Trump, and the rise of populist movements, [which are all racist].‚Äù After the attack on London, it was time for the leader of the free world, President Donald Trump, to set the record straight with Khan over his wimpy stance on Islamic terrorists. Trump delivered a nasty surprise, making a statement that called Khan out in front of the whole world as an epic failure as the Mayor of London. At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!" ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 4, 2017 So, did Khan have a comeback? Yes, he posted a tweet saying Londoners were going to get together to sing and hold hands in a field in remembrance of those murdered and injured. Khan tweeted, ‚ÄoeLondoners will come together on Potters Fields at 6 pm tomorrow to remember the victims of Saturday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s terror attack.‚Äù Wow, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s showing strength. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re sure the Islamic terrorists are quaking over the prospect of that going on. Khan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s representative did have a statement for Trump. ‚ÄoeIn response, a spokesman for Sadiq Khan said the mayor had ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks,'‚Äù reports The Guardian. No, Trump did not take Khan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s words out of context. Khan is such a despicable man, as Townhall reports, ‚ÄoeLondon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s first Muslim mayor, is a major proponent of open borders across the globe. During a trip to New York City in September of 2016, Khan lectured Americans on the reality of terror, saying that attacks are ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>part and parcel of life in a big city.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>‚Äù That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right, Khan actually is telling Americans to just get used to Islamic terror attacks because it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just part of being in a big city. Is that what this rat is telling the families of the seven slain in London? Is he patting them on their backs and whispering to them that we can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t control terror attacks? He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s truly perverted in his thoughts, a slimy slithering snake who somehow got elected mayor. I bet Londoners wish they could be rid of him today. President Trump will always tell us like it is, and he will always put the citizens he was elected to serve first, unlike that jackass Khan. Trump will unleash holy hell on those Islamic barbarians wherever they dare to rear their evil heads. Thank God, we are blessed with President Donald Trump. Patriots will continue to fight alongside him to make America great again as we refuse to make the same mistakes as our European friends when it comes to Muslim migration.
