Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano sat down with FOX Business Network on Monday to discuss the very serious allegations that Senator Rand Paul and another senator were placed under surveillance by the Obama administration. However, Napolitano ended up dropping an even bigger bombshell about the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died under suspicious circumstances. Rand Paul believes that the Obama administration intentionally spied on him in the fall of 2016 when he was running for president. ‚ÄoeIf they had to unmask Senator Paul‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s name to reveal a conversation he was having with a foreign agent and the foreign agent was hostile to the United States they can do that,‚Äù Napolitano explained, according to The Gateway Pundit. ‚ÄoeThat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not what he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s talking about. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re talking about unmasking him when he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s having a conversation with his campaign manager when he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s running in the Republican primary.‚Äù Once again, we see that former President Barack Obama was trying to meddle in the election in order to get Hillary Clinton elected. Ironically, the left won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t shut up about the bogus narrative that Russia manipulated the election in favor of President Donald Trump, for which there is absolutely no evidence, but they care little about the fact that Obama was potentially involved in illegal surveillance for political purposes. However, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the only bombshell Judge Nap dropped. Napolitano went on to reveal that Justice Scalia also believed he and other judges on the Supreme Court were being surveilled. ‚ÄoeJustice Scalia told me he often thought the court was being surveilled. And he told me that probably four or five years ago,‚Äù he said. Justice Antonin Scalia, the most noted conservative on the bench, was found dead with a pillow over his face, leading many to suggest foul play was involved in his demise. Adding to suspicions was the fact that no autopsy was ever performed to discover his true cause of his death. ‚ÄoeThe use of intelligence data for political purposes is a felony,‚Äù said Napolitano, who noted that the punishment for such a crime is between five and fifteen years in prison, depending on the severity of the offense. If it is uncovered that Barack Obama was involved in the unmasking of individuals to gain some political advantage, he could be going away for a very long time. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s one free ‚Äoevacation‚Äù he won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like, but many Americans won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mind their tax dollars funding his ‚Äoelifestyle.‚Äù
