Republican Karen Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff in an intense special House election Tuesday night, a disappointing setback for Democrats, who invested millions in capturing the long-standing Republican seat. Moments after the important GOP victory, people began noticing a ‚Äoestrange‚Äù coincidence surrounding the recent special elections which have been taking place from Montana to Georgia. Handel‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s victory was noteworthy for several reasons, not the least of which is the fact that she is now the first Republican woman from the state of Georgia to serve in the United States House of Congress. But, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expect her to get any credit from feminists. To them, strides made by women are only worth mentioning if the woman happens to be a liberal. The Georgia race also smashed fundraising records for a House contest. The campaigns for Handel and Ossoff, along with outside groups, spent a record $50 million. Ironically, most of Ossoff‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s $22 million in fundraising money came from the liberal haven of California. Perhaps it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not all that surprising that Ossoff garnered millions from California, though, when you consider the fact that he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even reside in Georgia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 6th Congressional District, which he ran to represent. Essentially, he was an outsider with tons of outside cash to help him win the race against Handel, and the people of Georgia saw right through him. Coincidentally, Handel does live amongst the people she will now represent in Congress. Just before voters headed off to the polls, Handel got a very important and well-timed endorsement from none other than President Donald Trump, who tweeted out his support in signature fashion, lauding the Republican as a ‚Äoehard worker who will never give up.‚Äù KAREN HANDEL FOR CONGRESS. She will fight for lower taxes, great healthcare strong security-a hard worker who will never give up! VOTE TODAY ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 20, 2017 Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enthusiastic support for Handel certainly paid off, because she crushed Ossoff in the election, even though the official polls projected a dangerously close race. Republican Karen Handel on Tuesday night defeated rival Jon Ossoff in Georgia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s record-spending, special-election congressional race, keeping yet another House seat in GOP hands and denying Democrats a chance to deliver a rebuke to President Trump. With all precincts reporting, Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, led Ossoff 52 percent to 48 percent ‚Ä" a margin of nearly 11,000 votes out of more than 250,000 ballots cast. [Source: Fox News] ‚ÄoeThis race was going to require all hands on deck, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what we had,‚Äù Handel said at her victory party. ‚ÄoeTonight‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s victory is for you. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s for every citizen in the 6th (Congressional) District.‚Äù Four House races since Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s inauguration have resulted in straight GOP wins. Democrats have proven to be utter failures when it comes to beating Trump. Now they must win 24 GOP seats to retake control of House in 2018. [Source: The Political Insider] Excited conservatives took to Twitter to congratulate the brand new congresswoman and hilariously mock Ossoff. Congratulations to Karen Handel on her big win in Georgia 6th. Fantastic job, we are all very proud of you! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 21, 2017 Congrats Karen Handel! Great campaign & great victory! With in the White House & you in Congress, we will #MAGA! üá∫üá∏ ‚Ä" Mike Pence () June 21, 2017 Laughing my #Ossoff ‚Ä" Kellyanne Conway () June 21, 2017 YES! In Georgia, won, "Pajama Boy" Osoff lost. Watch liberals explain away the significance. ‚Ä" Laura Ingraham () June 21, 2017 Congrats to on a big win in #ga6 tonight! We need more leaders like Karen in Washington. ‚Ä" Mitt Romney () June 21, 2017 The GOP also marked a pointed victory in South Carolina, where Republicans held onto the House seat vacated by White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, who resigned in February to join the Trump administration. Millionaire developer Ralph Norman, the Republican, defeated former Goldman Sachs tax adviser Archie Parnell, the Democrat, according to the Associated Press. So, this must be what Trump was referring to when he told us all there would be so much winning we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d get tired of it. Well, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not tired of it yet, but he was absolutely right about one thing: He was the man who could single-handedly usher in a new era of unbridled ‚Äoewinning‚Äù for traditional American values, which is precisely what we need to right the ship following Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s failure of a presidency.
