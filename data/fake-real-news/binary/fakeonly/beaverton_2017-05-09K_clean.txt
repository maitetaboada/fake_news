HAMILTON, ON ‚Ä" 31 year old Kevin Wilson has made an astonishing discovery. Early Saturday morning, while attempting to tie his shoes Wilson realized he was unable to bend over without making a strained ‚Äoewumopph‚Äù sound. ‚ÄoeI used to be a pretty fit guy,‚Äù explained Wilson. ‚Äoebut what with work responsibilities and my looming thirty-second birthday, I find myself making unexpected noises every time I move. Once when reaching for a book on a top shelf, I made the dog howl.‚Äù But frightening the dog is the least of Kevin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fears. ‚ÄoeThese noises afflicted my dad and grandfather, sure, but they were way older than me when they started ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>huummph-ing‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>eeeeeiissh-ing‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>‚Ä¶Wait am I old now? Oh no, no no! Whhhyyyee?!‚Äù Biologist at Trent University Dr. Robin Daniels, who has studied the phenomenon, which she describes as ‚ÄoeThe Sound.‚Äù ‚Äoe‚Ä<sup>~</sup>The Sound‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> can affect both men and women who aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t feeling as spry as they used to, or as what I like to think, life just beating the shit out of you the older you get,‚Äù said Dr. Daniels. ‚ÄoeThere are many noises that ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>The Sound‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> can take the form of, whether it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>sssshhhiieir‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> as one shifts in a chair, a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>harrruunnnf‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> while squeezing through a tight space, or a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>whatthefuckishappeningtomybody?!‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> while being on the receiving end of a firm handshake.‚Äù Though there is no cure for ‚ÄoeThe Sound,‚Äù Wilson is hopeful he can live a fulfilling life, knowing that ‚ÄoeThe Sound‚Äù could come out of him at any moment. ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s scary,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄoeOne minute I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m having a romantic dinner with my girlfriend when all of a sudden I drop my fork on the ground. Do I pick it up and risk a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>hsssnnfph‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, or ask her for a new fork? It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a lose-lose situation.‚Äù For now, Wilson says he finds comfort in small pleasures, like watching tennis matches saying, ‚ÄoeNow those are embarrassing sounds! Sounds like they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re having sex, amiriiiite!?‚Äù Wilson then attempted a high five, lost his balance and fell over and made the sound of two clay pots screeching together.
