Beaverton writers Cathryn Naiker and Dave Barclay are sports experts. Sort of. Well, theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re working on it. Join them as they discuss all the biggest stories, plus a lot of talk about the ridiculous side of being a fan. From hot takes on the NHL trade deadline to a serious look at which athlete makes the best wine, theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve got you covered. Cathryn and Dave do their first â€<sup>~</sup>Celebrated But Awfulâ€<sup>TM</sup> segment by telling us just how despicable some of the titans of the sports world are- this week we look at the secret offences of Michael Jordan and Alex Rodriguez. Theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re then joined by Madam Sportage, a spiritual medium who tells them whether the Blue Jays stole The Raptors spiritual energy â€" thereby ensuring their doom? They finish off with â€oeWhat NFL Scandal is Nextâ€<sup>TM</sup> where they super accurately predict the future of the NFL and all itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s players.
