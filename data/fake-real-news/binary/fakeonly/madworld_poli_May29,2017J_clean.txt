Like so many other liberals who think they know what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s best for the world, German Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to attack President Donald Trump recently. Unfortunately for the smug politician who decided to lecture the leader of the free world on the importance in taking in refugees, she wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t laughing just hours later after hearing what happened back home ‚Ä" and it rightfully gave her pause. Germany isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t too happy with the change in leadership here in the U.S., and it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take a whole lot of common sense to understand why. First of all, former President Barack Obama agreed with Merkel‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s liberal stance on just about everything. Secondly, Obama, just like Merkel, doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem to care about the people they govern over who disagrees with what they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re doing to their country, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a huge problem. In fact, it was that exact reason Donald Trump was elected since the American people felt left behind and disregarded during Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tenure. Despite this reality, Merkel is intent on continuing down the path that is actually hurting her country and putting the lives of German citizens at risk. As if that isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bad enough, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s since taken things one step further by publicly chastising a ‚Äoehostile‚Äù President Trump for putting the lives, safety, and well-being of Americans first, above all else, according to DownTrend. ‚ÄoeIt is not isolation and the building of walls that make us successful, but open societies,‚Äù Merkel says at NATO HQ d ‚Ä" CBS News () May 25, 2017 Speaking at the NATO summit in the Belgian capital of Brussels, Merkel was standing in front of a fragment of the Berlin Wall when she said, ‚ÄoeIt is not isolation and the building of walls that make us successful, but open societies.‚Äù Of course, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a big difference between walls that keep people in and those that keep danger out ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly the point of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wall, which Merkel is obviously missing. In fact, Merkel wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t so smug just a few hours later as a report was released proving just how wrong she was. Even worse yet (for her, that is), it came out of Germany, saying exactly how much her liberal agenda was hurting the German people. The number of refugees in Germany capable of committing terrorist attack [sic] in the country has quadrupled since 2011, the German Federal Criminal Police Office, BKA, told government broadcaster Deutsche Welle. Security concerns have heightened in Germany after close to a million refugees arrived in 2015 from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and North Africa. Fears worsened when more than 1,200 women were reportedly assaulted in various German cities on New Year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Eve in 2015. [Source: Fox News] So, basically, as Merkel was lecturing Trump on the importance of allowing refugees into America and having open borders, Germany was announcing that terror attacks were on the rise in Germany because of just that. Of course, the left was cheering the German Chancellor as if she was a hero for saying that to Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face, but really, she was digging her own grave, thanks to the information that would come just a few hours later. It goes without saying that there is a danger lurking in the Middle East and that leaders have a duty to their countrymen first and foremost. Unfortunately, liberals like Merkel seem to disregard that notion in the pursuit of ‚Äoepolitical correctness‚Äù ‚Ä" and it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter who gets hurt in the process. How many people need to die before the left realizes the threat that their agenda has on the entire world? It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time our world leaders place their loyalty where it needs to be before they find themselves being replaced. Just ask the Democrats of America how being stubborn in the face of a resistant populous worked out for them. They lost the House, Senate, and Presidency in one fell swoop ‚Ä" and their party continues to crumble as they refuse to change and do what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s best for their citizens.
