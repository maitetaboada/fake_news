President Donald Trump is spitting in the face of Angela Merkel and Barack Obama by saying, â€oeHell, noâ€ to the one thing they both very badly need. This is coming on the heels of Trumpâ€<sup>TM</sup>s first foreign trip, where he encountered Merkel on the same day she welcomed Obama to Germany. As the globalists overplayed their hand, Trump swept in like a wrecking ball, destroying everything they are working toward. President Trump is pissing off the globalists by pulling the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord. The Paris Climate Accord, also called the Paris Agreement, is the bogus agreement originally signed by 175 parties (174 states and the European Union) in 2016 that states climate change, also known as global warming, is man-made and requires countries to take taxpayer money to lower greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement says that â€oedeveloped countriesâ€ like America are responsible for coming up with $100 billion. Yes, thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s 100 billion dollars, but it goes further than that, bringing the world into a â€oeone world order.â€ This one agreement is essential for the globalists, and if the U.S. pulls out, it destroys the globalists dream. He is and he must withdraw. It nothing more than a Globalist tool for power,control,& monetary gain. â€" ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ARUNKğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· () May 28, 2017 The global warming nutjobs are rabid. They refuse to look at all the evidence and especially confront what happened in 2009, which proves climate change is all a hoax. There is a network of corruption and fraud behind the climate change science going back to 2009. Townhall reports on the corruption of the United Nations scientists involved, stating that â€oeclimate scientists had been cooking their data in order to support their preconceived conclusions. They had been guilty of practicing fake science in order to show both that global warming was a crisis and that anthropogenic (â€<sup>~</sup>man-madeâ€<sup>TM</sup>) global warming was occurring.â€ But, thereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s more to prove Trump is right to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord. Dr. John Bates, a top NOAA scientist with an impeccable reputation, has shown Daily Mail irrefutable evidence that the [climate change] paper was based on misleading, â€oeunverifiedâ€ data. As Daily Mail reports, â€oeA high-level whistleblower has told this newspaper that Americaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) breached its own rules on scientific integrity when it published the sensational but flawed report, aimed at making the maximum possible impact on world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015.â€ Thank God, President Trump has been able to cut through their crap and gets that this is all a scam. Completely pissed off, Merkel said, â€oeThe Paris deal isnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t just any other deal. It is a key agreement that shapes todayâ€<sup>TM</sup>s globalization,â€ describing discussions with Trump about climate change as â€oevery unsatisfying.â€ Why do both Obama and Merkel equate climate change to globalization? Because this whole global warming nonsense is just a scheme toward their dream of a world led by the United Nations, with open borders which, in part, is what globalization is to them. Funny, the other leaders at the G7 want to talk about fictional climate change. Why? Because it's a US wealth redistribution scam. â€" Bill Mitchell () May 26, 2017 This #ClimateChange racket is such a scam.With everything going on in the worldâ€¦must we worry about this #Hoax â€" TEAM TRUMPğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ () May 26, 2017 The Paris Climate Accord approves something called â€oesustainable developments.â€ This gives the United Nations rights over most of the rural lands in the U.S. with plans to develop â€oesustainableâ€ areas. Basically, it relocates all people into â€oestack and packâ€ housing in big urban areas. It sounds crazy, but it is happening in the San Francisco area, also called â€oePlan Bay Area.â€ President Trump landed a huge blow to their ultimate goal. He screwed them by saying, â€oeHell no,â€ to their leftist fantasy. We didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t vote for Donald Trump to sing kumbaya with the evil United Nations, we voted for Trump to secure our borders, bring jobs back to the U.S., and, ultimately, make America great again.
