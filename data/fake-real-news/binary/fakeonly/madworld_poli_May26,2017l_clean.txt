In the wake of President Donald Trumpâ€<sup>TM</sup>s recently released budget plan, which proposes a cut of $192 billion to the federal food stamp program over the next decade, thousands of Georgia welfare junkies have refused to comply with the new work standards for assistance recipients. As a consequence, they all woke up to a brutal surprise, which surely put a damper on their day. According to Fox News, approximately 1.6 million Georgia residents currently use food stamps, which are funded via federal dollars and managed by the Georgia Division of Family and Child Services (DFCS). However, in order to curb the rampant welfare fraud burdening hard-working taxpayers, the state has begun instituting work requirements for able-bodied adults without children. Officials started enforcing the work mandate in 2016 with Cobb, Gwinnett, and Hall counties. Food stamp recipients there were afforded three months to find a job or a training program, or risk having their benefits cut. Apparently, many of them could not be persuaded to work for their free food, despite being completely capable of doing so. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is now reporting that more than half of food stamp recipients in 21 Georgia counties have been dropped from the program following the new work mandates. Of the 11,779 people without kids and considered capable of working who were required to find a job by April 1 in order to continue receiving assistance, 62 percent were dropped after the deadline, decreasing the number receiving food stamps to just 4,528. With the resounding success of this first round of cuts, the plan is to grow the work requirement to all 159 counties in Georgia by 2019. Sixty more will be added in 2018. Meanwhile, a DFCS spokeswoman said that the department has offered to provide assistance with job searches and training to affected recipients. This new report would appear to confirm the stereotype that many people who use welfare are simply lazy. While there are families in need who use public assistance as a necessary means to get by for a fixed time period, there are far too many individuals who view it as a career choice. In Georgia, at least, there are more people using welfare who donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t need it than who do. The left loves to label conservatives as discriminatory and heartless for wanting to institute programs like work requirements for welfare recipients, but the only people being discriminated against are those who take advantage of the system. No children lost their food in Georgia as a result of the stateâ€<sup>TM</sup>s new mandate, yet thousands were cut from the food stamp program. This has proved to be a very effective way to get to trim the fat, so to speak, and other states ought to seriously think about doing the same thing.
