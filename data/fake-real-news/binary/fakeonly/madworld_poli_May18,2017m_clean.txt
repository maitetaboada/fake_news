Two of former President Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s friends have spoken with the media to expose the moment that he seemingly could not contain his anger any longer and suffered an explosive meltdown. It happened after he received an unexpected call from President Donald Trump, and he subsequently launched into a foul-mouthed tirade against his successor. Speaking to PEOPLE for the magazine‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s new cover story on Barack Obama and his wife Michelle adjusting to life outside the White House, the two friends revealed that Trump called Obama on election night to voice his ‚Äoerespect‚Äù and ‚Äoeadmiration‚Äù for the 44th president. This might come as a shock to those who watched Trump bemoan Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s policies for eight years and witnessed as he served as one of the most outspoken leaders of the birther movement, but more than anything else, it shows Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s true character. While he could have gloated over his hard-fought win against the establishment, he chose instead to graciously compliment Obama, who was no doubt having one hell of a night after watching Hillary Clinton lose and his legacy go up in smoke. However, Obama didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see it this way. ‚ÄoeHe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nothing but a bullshitter,‚Äù he reportedly told his friends last November after receiving Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s call. Of course, this is quite ironic coming from the man who told us all, ‚ÄoeIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor,‚Äù and that he would lead ‚Äoethe most transparent administration in history.‚Äù According to the sources, Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s opinion of Trump ‚Äoehasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t gotten any better‚Äù since Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been in office, either. This is not surprising, seeing as Obama has been made to watch as Trump systematically deconstructs his legacy bit by bit. ‚ÄoeHe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s deeply concerned with what he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s seen,‚Äù a third source close to Obama told PEOPLE. ‚ÄoeBut he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s also optimistic and heartened that citizens aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t just watching it happen but engaging with neighbors and elected representatives at town halls.‚Äù Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s longtime friend and political strategist David Axelrod, now director of the University of Chicago‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Institute of Politics, noted that George W. Bush refrained from criticizing Obama, who would, in turn, try to extend Trump the same courtesy. ‚ÄoeHe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s very respectful of the appropriate role of a former president and that ex-presidents should not be looking over the shoulder of their successors and commenting on every decision,‚Äù said Axelrod. ‚ÄoeObviously, this now is a unique set of circumstances, but my sense is that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to try and respect that tradition while reserving the right to speak out in given moments when things rise to that level.‚Äù Obama may not be speaking out publicly against Trump, but reports have surfaced that he is doing something much worse. It is believed that the former president is working to sabotage the Trump administration through government holdovers still loyal to him and a so-called ‚Äoeshadow government‚Äù or ‚Äoedeep state,‚Äù which he is operating behind the scenes. Meanwhile, Michelle Obama has been critical of Donald Trump, lambasting the current administration‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s decision to rollback her school lunch program at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference held last Friday. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really no surprise that the Obamas are having a hard time giving up control now that they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been ousted from the White House, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time they faded off into obscurity and let President Trump do his job. The American people have spoken, and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve made it clear that we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve had enough of Barack and Michelle to last a lifetime.
