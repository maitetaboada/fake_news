Barack Obama was interviewed by John F. Kennedy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s grandson, Jack Schlossberg, before accepting a JFK Profile In Courage Award. During their conversation, the former president tried to brag about one of his ‚Äoecourageous‚Äù accomplishments but ended up admitting to a massive failure instead. Politico is reporting that Obama described to Schlossberg a number of difficult decisions that he made as president. Sending troops into harm‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s way was ‚Äoethe hardest issue that I dealt with,‚Äù Obama said, adding that seeing and knowing people younger than Schlossberg, 24, ‚Äoewould be in a really dangerous situation, that was tough.‚Äù ‚ÄoeBut I actually think that the issue that required the most political courage was the decision not to bomb Syria after the chemical weapons use had been publicized and rather to negotiate them removing chemical weapons from Syria,‚Äù Obama said. Obama said that he drew a supposed ‚Äoered line‚Äù with respect to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s chemical weapons uses against his own people. He argued that, if Assad used chemical weapons again, he would provoke a US military response. Unfortunately, Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s military did not intervene even after Assad used the inhumane weapons on the Syrian people. The Obama administration continued to work towards a diplomatic solution. Obama went on to further describe his decision, as documented in the interview transcript at Medium: ‚ÄoeNow, we know subsequently that some remained, so it was an imperfect solution. But what we also know is that 99 percent of huge chemical weapons stockpiled were removed without us having to fire a shot. ‚ÄoeThe reason it was hard was because, as president, what you discover is that you generally get praised for taking military action, and you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re often criticized for not doing so. ‚ÄoeAnd it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a slam dunk, but I thought that it made sense for a variety of reasons for us to see if we could actually try to eliminate the prospect of large-scale chemical weapons use rather than the political expedience of a one-time shot.‚Äù Unfortunately, Assad continued to use chemical weapons, prompting Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s successor, President Donald Trump, to launch 59 Tomahawk missiles to disable a Syrian runway and send a strong message to the cruel dictator. The differences in results achieved when comparing these two presidents are clear and simple to describe. Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s diplomacy resulted in Assad‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s use of chemical weapons, more than once. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s military action, though it garnered worldwide attention and some controversy, sent a message that will cause Assad to think twice before using the weapons again. So, Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoe99 percent‚Äù solution ended up allowing the deaths of Syrian men, women, and children with the remaining ‚Äoe1 percent‚Äù of the chemical weapons. While Schlossberg and Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s friends in the liberal media continue to sing his praises while he is out of office, the rest of us see Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s description of these events for what it is: an example of failure. It is unlikely that the mainstream media will ever position Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s confession in this way, but we know the truth.
