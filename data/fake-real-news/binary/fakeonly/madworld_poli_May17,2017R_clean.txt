Last Wednesday, ABC confirmed that Last Man Standing, starring Tim Allen as the politically conservative and Christian character Mike Baxter, was being canceled despite strong ratings, and it didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take a genius to see what was going on. Allen and his show were getting the ax because of their right-leaning values. Just days later, ABC has been served a major dose of bad news, courtesy of American patriots. A fan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s petition to ABC to revive Last Man Standing has received more than 200,000 signatures in less than one week from American patriots who don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t appreciate having their views quashed. The Change.org petition titled ‚ÄoeSave Tim Allen‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Show ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Last Man Standing'‚Äù was launched by a fan calling himself ‚ÄoeDeputy Matt‚Äù last week and had received well over 200,000 signatures as of Wednesday morning. ‚ÄoeLast Man Standing stands out in the sea of network television sitcoms. It is a show that appeals to a broad swath of Americans who find very few shows that extol the virtues with which they can identify; namely conservative values,‚Äù the creator of the petition wrote. ‚ÄoeLast Man Standing is one of the only shows on broadcast television, and the only sitcom, that is not constantly shoving liberal ideals down the throats of the viewers,‚Äù the petition adds, according to Breitbart. ‚ÄoeAnd sadly, that is likely the real reason the show has been canceled.‚Äù Fans of Last Man Standing were shocked to learn the show was being canceled because it was the second most-watched comedy series on the network this season, only behind Modern Family, an even more impressive feat considering its notoriously difficult Friday night time slot. Needless to say, the fans didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t buy it when ABC cited ‚Äoebusiness and scheduling‚Äù conflicts as the reasons they axed the show. ‚ÄoeI canceled Last Man Standing for the same business and scheduling reasons I canceled The Real O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Neals, Dr. Ken, The Catch, American Crime,‚Äù said ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey. ‚ÄoeIt was challenging because it was a steady performer but when we made the decision not to continue with comedies on Friday that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s where it landed.‚Äù Perhaps Dungey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s explanation would be an easier pill to swallow if Hollywood executives weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t consistently trying to silence conservative voices. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s well known in Tinsel Town that you either tow the Democrat Party line or keep your mouth shut. Otherwise, you can virtually count on being blackballed by the elitist community of liberal celebrities. Of course, this does absolutely nothing to serve the fan base of those respective celebrities. As the ratings for Last Man Standing showed, Americans want to watch shows with a conservative message, and we have very few to choose from. If you would like to see Last Man Standing back on the air, sign Deputy Matt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s petition to defend conservative values on television and make sure you share this news with others who would also agree.
