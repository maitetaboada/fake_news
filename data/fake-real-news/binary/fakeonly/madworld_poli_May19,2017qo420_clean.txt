Maxine Waters has become a cult figure for the liberal loons who love her for the nonsense she spews against President Donald Trump on cable news shows. Maxine is feeling rather invincible by this newfound fame, and it loosened her tongue once again. This time, she outed herself as a full blown racist and a supporter of thugs who target white people. Now, her constituents are pissed off, calling for her impeachment. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Maxine Waters is a bumbling idiot who has no clue about right or wrong. In her twenty-seven years in politics, the California Congresswoman has only shilled for the Democrats and for targeted racism against whites. That may not be politically correct to say, but the evidence of Maxine‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bias goes back a long way. She gave the Huffington Post an interview on the 25 year anniversary of the L.A. riots recently, and instead of doing the moral thing, she doubled down on her support for the thugs who turned the city into a war zone. One of those thugs, Damian Williams, is a favorite of Waters. Williams is infamous for bludgeoning truck driver Reginald Denny with a brick. Along with three other thugs, he fractured Denny‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s skull in 97 different places. Denny was on life support and sustained severe brain damage as a result. ‚ÄoeNever forget that Maxine Waters embraced Damian Williams, the infamous thug who hurled a chunk of concrete at truck driver Reginald Denny and performed a victory dance over this innocent man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s battered body,‚Äù reports Independent. She then danced with notorious gang members when Williams was released from prison. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s [Maxine‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s] earned a lifetime of left-wing adoration for whitewashing the deadly riots as a ‚Äoerebellion,‚Äù excusing the week-long shooting, looting, and arson orgy as ‚Äoea spontaneous reaction to a lot of injustice and a lot of alienation and frustration,‚Äù and coddling Crips and Bloods gang members ‚Ä" with whom she performed the electric slide as part of her ‚Äoefearless support and understanding of young people and their efforts at self-expression.‚Äù [Source: New York Post] Newly nicknamed ‚ÄoeAuntie Maxine‚Äù by the liberals, in her interview with Huffington Post she went on a rant, glorifying violence. Waters claimed the L.A. riots were ‚Äoea milestone in the history of black people demanding justice. These were people who had been basically forgotten. And because of Rodney King‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s beating and the current emotion that was stirring in that, it was like people were saying, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re here. You can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do this to us. Look what you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re doing, look how you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been.'‚Äù She continued, ‚ÄoeSo it was a defining moment in this country and I think a defining moment in the way that black people resisted.‚Äù Just to give you an idea of how horrendous the beating of Reginald Denny was, the video below captured it, but be warned, it contains graphic violence. Maxine Waters‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> constituents are sick and tired of her antics. Known as the ‚Äoepoverty pimp,‚Äù Waters district encompasses areas that are infested with deadly gangs, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s so bad that she lives outside of her district. Republican Omar Navarro is challenging Maxine, and he led a protest outside her plush residence in Hancock Park, where an unidentified African American female holding a ‚ÄoeNo Justice, No Paycheck‚Äù sign said, ‚ÄoeI wanna hear ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>impeach or recall Maxine Waters.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> We have had enough‚Ä¶ She is not helping the black community‚Ä¶ Omar is for all Americans regardless of the color of their skin. Omar is in touch with everybody in the community. He wants what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s best for American citizens, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the way it should be.‚Äù The 43rd District could use a real change agent to help the citizens living in the crime-ridden area. Waters is an unethical hack who will lie and cheat just as long as it keeps good ole Auntie Maxine in business. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time those who adore her learn the full truth about their newest idol; she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a tool for violent extremism who has held her district hostage for far too long.
