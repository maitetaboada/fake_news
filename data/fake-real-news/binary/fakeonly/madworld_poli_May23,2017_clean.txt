Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell is having a nervous breakdown after she started a catfight over Barron Trump. Even Rosie‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s liberal cohorts are abandoning the hefty celebrity who has been critical of Melania Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mothering of Barron. Rosie lost control and is melting down, and you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll love how she is being put in her place by one of the craziest leftists out there. O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell is having a very bad day on social media. It seems she just discovered an article by liberal nutjob Lousie Mensch who told Rosie she is shameless for her attacks on Barron and Melania Trump. Mensch is a former British MP who thinks, among others things, that Andrew Breitbart was assassinated by Vladimir Putin so that Steve Bannon could someday wind up in the Trump administration. Still, even a broken clock is right twice a day. I absolutely believe that Andrew Breitbart was murdered by Putin, just as the founder of RT was murdered by Putin. ‚Ä" Louise Mensch () February 24, 2017 It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not Mensch‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s conspiracy theories about Putin that have Rosie bent out of shape. Rosie is so pissed off because it seems that Mensch published an article on Heat Street titled, ‚ÄoeMama Bear Melania Trump Is Absolutely Right to Sue ‚Ä" for Shame, Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell.‚Äù Although Mensch is nuts, she did get this one thing right, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s driving Rosie over the deep end. Louise got Rosie really upset since she wrote, ‚ÄoeOn Twitter, we call what Rosie did ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>concern trolling.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> I might ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>concern troll‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell like this: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Oh, Rosie, I feel for you! You must be suffering from depression over your OBESITY! All that FAT-SHAMING has gotten to you! I understand why you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d lose it over a beautiful woman‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s son, but try to get a grip on your mental health even if you can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get a grip on your waistline!'‚Äù Louise is referring to Rosie‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attack on Melania Trump last summer, in which she claimed Barron was autistic. She used a YouTube video to allege that Barron Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s behavior reminded her of an autistic boy. This was way over the line since Rosie has never been in the same room as Barron, and it was all just a way for Rosie to get attention for herself. Melania fought back through her attorneys. ‚ÄoeMelania Trump has hired a famous lawyer who is now threatening a lawsuit over a video suggesting her 10-year-old son, Barron, is autistic, and the letter calls out Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell as a bully,‚Äù reported TMZ. ‚ÄoeAccording to the letter, obtained by TMZ, the YouTube video falsely insinuates Barron is autistic. The letter, and our sources familiar with the situation, say Barron absolutely is not autistic.‚Äù Even though it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s obvious Rosie‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wrong, Rosie still got nasty with Louise Mensch after she came across the article that called her out for being a shameless bully. I have come to respect you greatly, and forgot about that piece, but I stand by it. Kids are off limits. I do believe you meant no harm. ‚Ä" Louise Mensch () May 23, 2017 ‚Ä" u researched it ‚Ä" like an impartial reporter? IF that's true ‚Ä" IF u really looked at the whole story ‚Ä" u r a shit reporter ‚Ä" ROSIE () May 23, 2017 Others liberals also began freaking out as two of their idols were caught up in a very public catfight, and they had no idea who to side with since both Louise and Rosie garner much of their following because they engage in the same conspiracy theories about Russia and Trump. So, when Rosie‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s friends tried to back her up, it went all wrong as they said that Louise Mensch is just a propagandist who sees Russia behind everything going on in America. It looks like Rosie‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s catfight with Louise Mensch didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go so well. Even though Louise is crazy, she can make sense like she did when she called out Rosie on her ‚Äoeconcern trolling.‚Äù It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s awesome when liberals engage in a circular firing squad; they do all the hard work of discrediting each other so we conservatives can sit back and just watch the show. This was very entertaining, thanks to both Lousie Mensch and Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell being drama queens.
