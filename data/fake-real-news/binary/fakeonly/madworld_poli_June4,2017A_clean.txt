The Executive Editor of the New York Times recently sat down to answer a few questions, but things didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exactly go according to plan. As it turns out, he would let something that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d kept a secret for quite some time accidentally slip ‚Ä" and now, liberals are in a downright panic. The incident took place during an interview at Recode‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Code Conference while Dean Baquet, the New York Times executive editor, was sitting on the stage. Of course, the audience was full of eager young minds just waiting to be brainwashed by the leftist agenda ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly what they got. However, things would take a shocking turn as the man made an accidental admission while answering a question. At the time, Baquet was critiquing liberals who lambasted him for hiring Bret Stephens, a moderately conservative columnist: ‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand how one can actually have an intellectual discourse in this country if you cannot have the opportunity to read thoughtful people with whom you disagree. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re at a moment in the country right now which I think, you know, the left should do some soul searching too, right?‚Äù However, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about the time he royally screwed the pooch. According to The Gateway Pundit, Baquet ‚Äoethen goes on to refer to ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> as ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> before realizing‚Äù that he messed up: ‚ÄoeWe don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to hear anything ‚Ä" we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve long said this about this about the Right ‚Ä" but I think the left, we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ‚Ä" I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>we,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m a journalist ‚Ä" but the left as a rule does not want to hear thoughtful disagreement . . .‚Äù Most of the right already understands that the New York Times is a heavily left leaning publication. Unfortunately, liberals are too blind to see that this is actually the case and read it under the assumption that they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re ingesting, truthful, unbiased news. Unfortunately for them, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hard to deny the truth after this admission from the editor himself. Of course, since Baquet let the truth slip, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s out there for the world to see ‚Ä" whether the left chooses to acknowledge it or not. In the end, all they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re doing is staying inside their little bubble while continuing to believe that their view of certain things is actually the truth. The left likes to attack the right for not wanting to acknowledge truth or facts that are inconvenient to our narrative, but that just isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the case. You see, what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really happening is the left likes to nitpick facts to prove their stance while, at the same time, removing any and all common sense. If we are being completely honest, humans are biased by nature. There really isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a single publication out there that doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have some degree of bias. The difference is, some of us are honest about it. Most on the right acknowledge that our commentary is coming from a Christian conservative perspective, where the left ignorantly denies their own bias. It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take a genius to see that not everything is black and white. However, when you take out logic and replace it with selective facts in hopes that no one looks further into the matter at hand, well, you get things like the New York Times ‚Ä" a publication that is constantly trying to brainwash people into a political ideology rather than offer the unbridled truth. You may not be able to polish a turd, but you can certainly roll it around in glitter ‚Ä" and the New York Times has certainly perfected that art. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re still stuck trying to sell liberal crap, and everyone can smell it a mile away.
