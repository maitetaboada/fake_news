Kellyanne Conway, the Senior Adviser to President Donald Trump, is sick and tired of the liberal media hacks attacking her. One very vicious and rather personal attack came from ‚ÄoeMorning Joe‚Äù hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough. It was so horrendous, Kellyanne decided enough was enough, and she just flattened those idiots. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll love that their big fat liberal mouths have been shut for good when it comes to her. Mika Brzezinski‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s anger and hatred showed all over her face as she brought up Kellyanne Conway out of nowhere during MSNBC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s low rated show, ‚ÄoeMorning Joe.‚Äù Mika seems jealous of Kellyanne as she couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help but attack her on live TV. ‚ÄoeThis is a woman who came on our show during the campaign and would shill for Trump in extensive fashion,‚Äù said Brzezinski. ‚ÄoeAnd then she was turned off the air, the camera would be turned off, the microphone would be turned off, and she would say, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Blah, I need to take a shower,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> because she disliked her candidate so much.‚Äù Then, Mika‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fiance and co-host Joe Scarborough had to chime in like an old lady gossiping, saying, ‚ÄoeShe said, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>This is just my summer vacation, my summer in Europe and basically I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m just going to get through this.'‚Äù No one in their right mind who has watched Kellyanne over the last few months would buy such bullcrap. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s apparent these two are pissed off because President Trump refuses to do their show and so does Kellyanne. Out of all the morning cable news shows, their ratings are consistently the lowest. Not only that, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s widely known that news shows have certain rules about what guests can expect. Tucker Carlson commented on this situation and said that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s known a host never remarks on air what a guest said off the air, so he puts zero credibility into what the sad duo of ‚ÄoeMorning Joe‚Äù had to say. Kellyanne needs no back-up to take them on anyway. She blasted them with a post on Twitter. Instead of lowering herself to how they behave, she took the high road, and Americans loyal to Trump weighed in, wishing her well. Taking a moment from more important matters to respond ‚Ä¶. ‚Ä" Kellyanne Conway () May 16, 2017 Kellyanne hit the nail on the head when it comes to blasting Mika and Joe. In the beginning of the campaign, Trump had no choice but to grant interviews to ‚ÄoeMorning Joe.‚Äù But, after he got the nomination, he was through with them, and they were livid. You see, Trump brought ratings, which they sorely needed, so they fawned over Trump to the chagrin of everyone else over at MSNBC. Then, Trump cut them off, letting them high and dry. Immediately, they changed their tune. No longer would they be getting the ratings which came with Trump, so it is Mika and Joe who will do anything for money and ratings, not Kellyanne. Trump is too smart to not know who is loyal to him, so Mika and Joe can go back to last place on cable news.
