On Tuesday, filthy rich former President Barack Obama pocketed over $3.26 million for a speech in which he chastised citizens for not doing enough to help reverse ‚Äoeclimate change.‚Äù However, after one camera captured what the smug elitist was doing just before his overpriced appearance, Obama was hoping his critics wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see him in such a compromising position. Liberals are almost as good at convincing the world that they care about the Everyman as they are at reaching into his pockets to pay for their policies. Of course, when Obama was still in the White House, he perfected the art of forcing American taxpayers into funding not only his globalist mandates but his countless lavish vacations as well. Now that he must foot his own exorbitant lifestyle, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s discovered a way to milk every last penny from his fanatical saps while once again exempting himself from his own ‚Äoechange.‚Äù While on his way to the Global Food Innovation Summit in Milan on May 9 to pick up his $3.26 million check for bashing his inferior audience, Obama was caught mocking his own initiative on ‚Äoeclimate change‚Äù in the most obnoxious way. Just before calling on conference-goers to take measures to reduce their carbon footprint and exhaust output, Obama was caught on video inundating the summit with a 14 vehicle escort of gas-guzzling armored SUVs, the Express reports. Of course, his hypocrisy didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t end there. Before he and his posse climbed into their fuming motorcade, Obama was flown to Italy in private jet to a $20,000-a-night hotel, escorted by 300 police officers by motorcycle and car, and accompanied by a helicopter for air security, according to the Daily Mail. The media was relatively silent as the ‚Äoegood for me but not for thee‚Äù former president negated his entire climate change campaign with his massive cavalcade‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s emissions. ‚ÄoeI do not believe that this planet is condemned to ever rising temperatures,‚Äù he told the conference. ‚ÄoeI believe these are problems that were caused by men and can be solved by men.‚Äù Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ironic and hypocritical move sparked controversy and comparison to A-list actor and global warming spokesperson Leonardo DiCaprio‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s notorious emission production. ‚ÄoeIt seems like Obama has taken a page out of Leonardo DiCaprio‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s book of ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>do as I say, not as I do,'‚Äù wrote the Independent Journal Review. ‚ÄoeDuring his post-presidency vacation, Obama spent many weeks in French Polynesia on music mogul David Geffen‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 450ft superyacht, which surely does not frugally sip fossil fuels like he wants the rest of the country to do.‚Äù DiCaprio came under fire in 2016 for using his private jet during a trip from Cannes to New York to accept an award for his alleged efforts to protect the environment. Tuesday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s irony was thick as 3,500 audience members shelled out over $900 per ticket to be bashed as gas-guzzling Obama scolded them for damaging the environment. In addition, the former president repurposed Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s infamous ‚Äoepiece of their pie‚Äù speech to remind everyone else that they must give up comforts that he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t plan on relinquishing any time soon. ‚ÄoeAs people want to increase meat consumption, that in turn is spiking the growth of greenhouse emissions coming out of the agricultural sector,‚Äù he said. Therefore, more advanced countries, he said, would have to teach people to ‚Äoehave a smaller steak.‚Äù Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s motorcade was so immense that it reportedly brought Milan to a ‚Äoestandstill.‚Äù Perhaps when he spoke of reducing the carbon footprint, he meant that his own luxuries would force the plebs beneath him to refrain from driving altogether ‚Ä" at least while he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in town. Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hypocrisy perfectly sums up the issue with the Democratic Party. They simply cannot grasp that they are distancing themselves from voters because of their out-of-touch policies. Voters are getting sick of hearing wealthy politicians rebuke them for not doing enough while banking millions for their berating speeches.
