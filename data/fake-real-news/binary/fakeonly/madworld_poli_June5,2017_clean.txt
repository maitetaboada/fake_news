CNN‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s so-called ‚ÄoeMuslim expert‚Äù Reza Aslan found himself in hot water after going on a profanity-laced tirade against President Donald Trump. Aslan, who hosts a series called ‚ÄoeBeliever,‚Äù tried to backtrack and defend his comments. President Trump, who doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t miss a thing, made sure Aslan got a nasty surprise that made clear who was in charge of the country. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Reza Aslan once ate human brains on television, so maybe that is his excuse for being a total jerk to President Donald Trump. As Fox News reports, ‚ÄoeAslan met with the Aghoris of India and took part in some of their rituals which include smearing ashes on his face and eating a human brain which he said was ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>burnt to a crisp‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and tasted like ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>charcoal.'‚Äù Regardless of the reason behind his behavior, Aslan found himself at the center of a media firestorm over the weekend when he responded with a potty-mouthed epithet to President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tweet that reiterated his call for a travel ban. All Trump was calling for are measures to keep our country safe. In fact, the travel ban is for a six-month period, until our intelligence agencies can guarantee that they can verify the background of refugees. Aslan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tweet shows a certain psychosis that this guy must be suffering from. Aslan tried to apologize, but his apology fell flat because he was lying his butt off. He said, ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not like me‚Äù to use profanity, except he uses it all the time. The guy cusses up a storm, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s always directed at someone he disagrees with. He also showed zero class by not apologizing to Trump. I should not have used a profanity to describe the President when responding to his shocking reaction to the #LondonAttacks. My statement: ‚Ä" Reza Aslan () June 4, 2017 Reza Aslan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s prior tweets to VP Mike Pence and President Donald Trump are seen below, but as he said, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not like him to use profanity. And Jesus said, "if someone tries to ask you a question, beat the shit out of them." ‚Ä" Reza Aslan () May 26, 2017 Oh the joy when this lying conniving scumbag narcissistic sociopath piece of shit fake president finally gets what's coming to him. ‚Ä" Reza Aslan () May 10, 2017 Well, it was almost as if Aslan set President Trump off on a tirade. Trump reacted by sending out tweet after tweet in a nasty surprise that must have made Aslan explode. ‚ÄoeIn any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!‚Äù tweeted Trump, and then, he posted, ‚ÄoePeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!‚Äù Then, he posted this tweet below, as the cherry on top, directed at the mainstream media, which Aslan is a part of. Trump made it clear, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the President of the United States and Aslan is a nobody who sides with idiots who think there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no reason to be alarmed when we have terrorists running around with knives and trucks. Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his "no reason to be alarmed" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 5, 2017 Reza Aslan is getting worse news too since it looks like CNN is thinking about firing him as their ‚ÄoeMuslim expert.‚Äù The University of California at Riverside employs him as a creative writing professor, where UCR spokesman John Warren confirmed that Aslan still teaches creative writing there and said the university did not have a statement Sunday regarding his foul-mouthed tweet. However, UCR is a pretty conservative university, so it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s safe to say he is on the chopping block there too for his profanity-laced comments towards the President. Like Mike Huckabee said, ‚ÄoeAslan must have eaten his own brain,‚Äù and we have to agree. Reza Aslan is on his way out of any gainful employment, a victim of his own stupidity and arrogance.
