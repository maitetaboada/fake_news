Kathy Griffin, the ‚ÄoeD-list‚Äù comedian, must be trying to beat Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell as the most disgusting Trump-hater on earth. Griffin is crying for attention, and it was so evident after she decided to threaten President Donald Trump with one of the most blood-thirsty sick scenes. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s so horrendous, patriots are calling for Griffin to be put in prison. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll want her to go there too after you see just how sick these liberal losers are truly becoming. Kathy Griffin posed with the severed head of President Donald Trump in a bloody photo shoot for artist and photographer Tyler Shields this week. In one image obtained by TMZ, the 56-year-old My Life on the D-List comedian looks directly into the camera while hoisting up Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s severed head, which is covered in dark red blood. According to the gossip outlet, Griffin joked during the photo shoot that she and Shields, who is known for his shocking artwork, would need to flee the country after the pictures came out for fear of imprisonment. ‚ÄoeGriffin has been an outspoken critic of the president; in October, the comedian and television personality cut a mock campaign advertisement which featured her repeatedly telling the then-Republican presidential candidate to ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>f*ck off,'‚Äù reports Breitbart. KATHY GRIFFIN: via ‚Ä" Tyler Shields () May 30, 2017 Breitbart also reports, ‚ÄoeThe gruesome photo isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the first ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>artwork‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> to depict Trump being beheaded; in August, a cartoon version of Trump had his head cut off in an issue of the comic book Spawn, while comedian George Lopez previously tweeted a cartoon image of notorious drug lord El Chapo beheading Trump in March of last year.‚Äù When they go low, we go ISIS video. ‚Ä" neontaster () May 30, 2017 Perhaps no one noticed but isn't this typical terrorist behavior..someone needs to report this action & ohh i just did ‚Ä" Kittens For Trump () May 30, 2017 Thank you! Ive been saying the left are demon possessed for years, they are evil. ‚Ä" Kolleen4Trump#MAGA () May 30, 2017 Unsurprisingly, the leftist rag site Huffington Post is making light of this with their headline, ‚ÄoeSo, Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Kathy Griffin Holding A Very Fake, Very Bloody Donald Trump Head.‚Äù Notice the ‚Äoevery fake‚Äù lingo as if to say, ‚Äoeno big deal.‚Äù Can you just imagine if this fake head belonged to Barack Obama? It would be immediately taken down by social media, but Twitter is keeping the sick post up. Not only that but if someone did do that to anyone, people with a conscience would call it out as obscene and wrong. Well, at least some are calling out CNN who has a contract with Grifin for some New Year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Eve gig. Joe Concha, a reporter for The Hill tweeted, ‚ÄoeIf you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re CNN, you announce immediately that Kathy Griffin will no longer be hosting your New Year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Eve special right now w/o hesitation.‚Äù Is this woman‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s life so pathetic that she has to do something so horrible to get attention? I guess so. Kathy Griffin should be charged with whatever law enforcement can charge her with, and she should then have to pay a hefty fine and spend time in jail, preferably in North Korea. Maybe Kim Jung Un would like to have her, I know most Americans would love to see her deported right away.
