Yet another group of entitled brats decided that they would attend a speech being made by President Donald Trump and do their best to disrupt the event. Unfortunately for them, things took a shocking turn as they heard the crowd‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s thunderous response ‚Ä" and they had learned just how big of a mistake they had made way too late. The incident took place during a rally-style event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, as Trump offered his thoughts and prayers for those most recently injured in the Virginia shooting. However, The American Mirror reports that not everyone in the crowd was in a humble and respectful mood as a few liberals were soon to reveal themselves. Just as Trump mentioned House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who was shot along with four others by left-wing gunman James T. Hodgkinson, all hell broke loose. For some reason, this is the time that 5 leftists thought it was appropriate to rise to their feet and begin to blow whistles in a desperate attempt to disrupt the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s speech. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend, somebody that I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve gotten to know very well, Steve Scalise, and everyone recovering from the assault,‚Äù Trump said. At that point, the entitled liberals started to make a ruckus ‚Ä" but it seems they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t count on one thing. Come to find out, the liberals would only learn just how big of a mistake they had made after seeing who was in the crowd ‚Ä" but by then, it was too late. According to IJ Review, the entire crowd banded together to shout ‚ÄoeUSA! USA! USA,‚Äù over and over again. Of course, they were easily able to drown out the noise with a call of patriotism. Unity is one thing the divisive left doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand, so these leftist punks were not expecting everyone in the audience to act together as one with such ease. Democrats just keep losing. Everywhere they look, they are losing. They lost the presidential election, and they continue to lose special elections, one right after another. The Democratic Party is in deep trouble. Although they were initially blaming Hillary Clinton, now they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re taking aim at current leadership like Nancy Pelosi. However, when it comes down to it, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s message that is severely flawed. Not only does their constant politically correct B.S. not resonate with nearly as many Americans as they think it does, but they constantly stir division, even within their own party. A unified party that has the best interest of all Americans in mind will get further than one which attempts to cater to special interest groups. In fact, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why Donald Trump won despite everyone saying that he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stand a chance. We proved them wrong once, and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll just keep doing it every time some self-righteous idiot wants to pretend that their opinion is worth more than others. In the end, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re all Americans, and we all have the same rights.
