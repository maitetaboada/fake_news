While Rep. Steve Scalise was fighting for his life after being shot by a left-wing gunman, a Democrat official unleashed a vulgar tirade, mocking the critically injured congressman and saying that he hopes he dies. However, not long after laughing about the horrific shooting, the liberal politician‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s smile quickly faded when he received brutal news. As the co-chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s technology committee, Phil Montag had secured the perfect position to not only campaign for Hillary Clinton but spew his leftist hatred for anything remotely conservative. Showing his liberal tolerance, Montag went on a vile rant about Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), who was recently shot during the June 14 Republican congressional baseball practice. While Scalise was still in critical condition, Montag mocked the hospitalized father-of-two, confessing that he hopes the Republican Representative dies from his injuries. According to Breitbart, Montag showcased his virulent hatred toward Scalise simply because of his beliefs during what he thought was a private conversation. Unfortunately for him, the threatening comments had been recorded, which was revealed to him just moments after his incriminating tirade. ‚ÄoeThat motherf**ker, the one that was shot‚Ä¶. this motherf**ker, like his whole job is like to get people, to convince Republicans to f**king kick people off f**king health care,‚Äù he said in a heated discussion. ‚ÄoeI hate this motherf**ker. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m glad he got shot, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m glad he got shot. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not going to f**king say that in public,‚Äù he said before adding: ‚ÄoeI wish he was f**king dead.‚Äù The Omaha World-Herald reports that Montag has been fired for his outrageous comments and is expected to answer to the police after making death threats about a government official. Fearing his imminent termination and possible investigation, Montag hastily issued a statement denying the intention of the explicit comments, claiming that they were deliberately distorted. ‚ÄoeI did not call for the congressman‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s death,‚Äù Montag said. ‚ÄoeLike every decent American I am saddened and horrified by the shooting of Congressman Scalise. I do not and did not wish for his death. I am hopeful that the entirety of the original, unedited recording will emerge so we can get to the truth of the matter.‚Äù Montag soon discovered that even his liberal constituents can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help him recover from such disturbing statements as Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb removed him immediately after she was sent the link to the recording. Kleeb also confirmed that she has spoken to the police about the incident and that they possibly looking into charges. ‚ÄoeThis is the first I am hearing this,‚Äù Kleeb said by email Thursday morning. ‚ÄoeAs soon as I heard it, I sent it to the (party) officers and then sent an email to Phil Montag informing him I am removing him from his appointed position as Co-Chair of the Technology Committee. ‚Ä¶ Wishing a Member of Congress or any individual dead is disgusting and has no place in our party.‚Äù Montag and all other liberals who spew this hateful rhetoric are not so different from James Hodgkinson, the gunman who shot Scalise and 4 others. They all want conservatives dead. The only thing that separates them is Hodgkinson‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s determination. While liberals cowardly fantasize about murdering Republicans in mock assassinations, their political guns-for-hire act upon those fantasies, not giving the left the outcome they desired but also the opportunity to protect themselves by pretending to condemn it. As disturbing as his words are, Montag is not an ‚Äoeextremist‚Äù in the liberal community. Apart from the death threats, celebrations of violence, and calls for physical retaliation against President Donald Trump, the left would love nothing more than to rid the world of those who don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think exactly as they do.
