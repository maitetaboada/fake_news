Over the weekend, California Democrats gathered in Sacramento for a state convention. At one point during what turned out to be nothing more than another hate-fest from the ‚Äoetolerant‚Äù left, they began to raise their middle fingers and chant, ‚ÄoeF*ck Donald Trump.‚Äù Unfortunately, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the worst part, considering the one vile thing Nancy Pelosi was caught doing in the background. While California‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s state Democrat Chairman John Burton was speaking, he decided to encourage the crowd to disrespectfully chant, ‚ÄoeF*ck Donald Trump,‚Äù while raising two middle fingers in the air. Although what he did was completely unnecessary, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was seen doing in the background that truly showed her character ‚Ä" and it only took one vile act. But first, have a look at the disrespectful display from the audience.

Although we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve come to expect this sort of behavior from liberals, what Pelosi did has many saying she went too far. It was all caught on camera when Burton had the entire crowd revved up and disrespectfully chanting against our Commander-in-Chief. ‚ÄoeAll together now,‚Äù he declared while encouraging them to raise their middle fingers, according to Biz Pac Review. ‚ÄoeF**k Donald Trump,‚Äù he added. Unfortunately, as disgusting as Burton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s act was, Pelosi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s response was even viler. As she joined in, she did one thing that could make any true patriot cringe ‚Ä" she laughed.

It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sickening to see how our nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Democratic leaders are influencing their supporters to behave. You would think that they would encourage peace within our country and perhaps help spread a positive message by working together to tackle the problems our nation faces. Of course, this is the Democrats we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re talking about, and if we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve learned anything since President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s victory against Hillary Clinton, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s that Democrats are anything but respectful, and they will say and do whatever it takes to get their point across, even if it makes them look like tantrum-throwing idiots. If they had half the brains they claim, they would use their energy to work together to prepare for the future. Instead, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re wasting their own time and effort, focusing on creating fake news about Trump and disrespecting him at every opportunity they get. Of course, until they get over their bruised egos, Donald Trump will continue to make the necessary changes to our nation one step at a time, making America truly great again. Perhaps the best part about their idiocy is the fact that they are their own worst enemies, giving Americans plenty of reasons to vote them out and help Trump drain the swap.
