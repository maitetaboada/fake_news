Laura Loomer, a hardcore investigative reporter at Rebel Media, showed up at the New York City ‚ÄoeAnti-Sharia Law‚Äù protest with a sign saying, ‚ÄoeThere is no such thing as an Islamic feminist.‚Äù She really triggered one thug and other social justice snowflakes after she did what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s being described as ‚Äoeone badass move.‚Äù Loomer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nasty surprise caused them to viciously attack her, but she refused to back down. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. The anti-Sharia protests, headed up by ‚ÄoeACT for America,‚Äù a group which monitors radical Islamism, took place in more than 20 cities across the nation. ‚ÄoeParticipants in the anti-Sharia rally say they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re worried that Islamic law could influence U.S. courts and harm women, among other concerns,‚Äù The Wall Street Journal reports. Despite Islam not being a race, counter-demonstrators claim the rallies are ‚Äoestirring racism.‚Äù One of the biggest protests happened in New York City, where Rebel Media‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Laura Loomer was on hand with a plan to show the liberal nutjobs just how out of touch they are on feminism and Islam. Loomer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s plan involved the ‚ÄoeFearless Girl‚Äù statue. The famous ‚ÄoeFearless Girl‚Äù bronze statue depicts a ‚ÄoeLatina girl staring at the Wall Street Bull statue,‚Äù and it was commissioned by a bunch of Wall Street feminists. The inscription under the statue reads, ‚ÄoeKnow the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference.‚Äù Loomer, with her sign in hand, marched over to the Fearless Girl statue, pulled out a burka, and with shocked tourist watching, covered up Fearless Girl with the burka. ‚ÄoeI wanted to take my sign to the statue which is supposed to be a protest against patriarchy and capitalism ‚Ä" to protest the most vile and oppressive patriarchy in the world, which is Islam. I also wanted to expose the hypocrisy of the left, as nobody there would disavow the patriarchy that is Sharia while celebrating this statue,‚Äù reports Loomer. Literally the most badass thing ever, especially with the angry dudes trying to grab it from you ‚Ä" Cassandra Fairbanks () June 10, 2017 ‚ÄoeYou guys don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to take pictures with it? Why not? Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you like the image of a woman in a burka? This isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t enough feminism for you?‚Äù Loomer asked the upset crowd. Then, an Islamic bully jumped in and grabbed Loomer, saying, ‚ÄoeLet‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s go ahead and take this off,‚Äù to which Loomer responded, ‚ÄoeI have a right to protest, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you have respect for all the women in Islam who have to wear this, aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you against the patriarchy?‚Äù The man shot back, condescending, ‚ÄoeWhy don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you put that on, that would be best.‚Äù Other liberal loons joined in, pushing Loomer aside, proving they are a bunch of hypocrites who claim to be for human rights but refuse to acknowledge the huge point Loomer is making about Islam oppressing women. The video of the ordeal will piss you off. ‚ÄoeLoomer was attempting to raise awareness of the oppression of women and girls under Islamic law, which includes brutal female genital mutilation ‚Ä" like a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>fearless girl‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> herself. Yet, the women fawning over the statue did not appreciate being confronted with Loomer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s real and meaningful feminism,‚Äù reports Big League Politics. It took a lot of guts to put a burka on Fearless Girl with thousands of liberal nutjobs looking on. It was a brilliant plan to expose the hypocrisy of Islamists and liberals alike who align themselves with those encouraging such an oppressive ideology while calling conservatives ‚Äoeracists‚Äù for pointing out that Fearless Girl wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be allowed to be fearless nor would she be dressed in Western clothes if governed by Sharia law. Unfortunately, facts don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter to the left, as we all know. However, what matters to us is fighting back against Islam, exposing its sick agenda to bring about a worldwide caliphate where all are forced to follow Sharia law and to make damn sure it never is the law of the land in the United States.
