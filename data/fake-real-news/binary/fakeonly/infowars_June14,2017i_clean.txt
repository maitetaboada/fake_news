66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson, the gunman who targeted Republican lawmakers during an attempted massacre this morning, has been confirmed as a Bernie Sanders-supporting leftist who called Trump a ‚Äoetraitor‚Äù and wanted to destroy him. On his Facebook page, Hodgkinson has a giant picture of Bernie Sanders as his banner image. The gunman called Trump a ‚Äoetraitor‚Äù and vowed to ‚Äoedestroy‚Äù him. The shooter also signed a petition calling for an investigation into Trump-Russia ties, confirming he was radicalized by the mainstream media‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s obsession with conspiracy theories about Russia interfering with the election. Hodgkinson also labeled Trump ‚ÄoeTruly the Biggest Ass Hole We Have Ever Had in the Oval Office.‚Äù ‚ÄoeTrump is Guilty & Should Go to Prison for Treason,‚Äù the shooter posted just two days ago. He also called Trump a ‚Äoemean, disgusting person.‚Äù The shooter was a fan of John Oliver, Rachel Maddow, and The Daily Show. A terrorist attack targeting conservatives by a deranged anti-Trump, Russian collusion-obsessed leftist It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to be hard for MSM to spin that. This is a game changer. When will the mainstream media stop radicalizing domestic terrorists with their hysterical anti-Trump narrative? It has to stop now before more innocent people are targeted. More as it breaks‚Ä¶.
