Saudi King Salman has drawn the ire of radical Muslims everywhere by violating one of the Quran‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sacred commands. President Donald Trump, his wife, and their entourage landed in Saudi Arabia on Saturday, May 20, for the initial stop on Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s first trip abroad as president. When they disembarked Air Force One, King Salman was captured on video doing to Melania what is strictly forbidden in the Islamic holy book. Saudi Arabia was noticeably thrilled to have been chosen by Trump as his first overseas destination while president. As noted by his senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, the significance of the trip was profound, and the Saudis know it. Most presidents travel to Canada or Mexico upon entering office, but Trump picked the center of the Muslim world, sending a strong message about reestablishing diplomatic ties in the region and uniting to defeat terrorism.

And he begins in the seat of the Muslim world where many of the most important monuments, if you will, or holy places in the Muslim religion are in this country." ‚Ä" Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway. Posted by Judge Jeanine Pirro on Saturday, May 20, 2017 ‚ÄoeTrump, his wife, Melania, and an entourage including virtually his entire senior White House staff and much of his Cabinet, were serenaded by military bands, treated to a flyover of Saudi jets, feted in opulent palaces and given the undivided attention of King Salman,‚Äù reported The Washington Post. It was a far cry from the way former President Barack Obama was treated when he visited the country. The way the president and his wife were greeted by King Salman was also quite different from the welcome extended to Barack and Michelle Obama years prior. As beautiful Melania descended the steps of Air Force One, she was not wearing a headscarf, even though the Saudi Arabian government requires women to wear a hijab. It was a strong but silent demonstration that she does not intend to allow the Muslim world to dictate the way she dresses or behaves. This was quite significant in and of itself, but then King Salman did something totally unexpected. After shaking President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hand, he extended his arm to shake Melania‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hand, too, an act which is strictly forbidden in the Quran. According to the Quran and Hadiths, Muslim men strictly forbidden to shake hands with non-Musim women. The King must be a special Muslim? ‚Ä" Blazing Fury () May 20, 2017 üÜ<sup>~</sup>‚ÄºÔ∏è #Melania #Trump in #SaudiArabia!

For her part, Melania has been making strides for women around the globe who see her as a beacon of equality, even in countries where they are still very oppressed. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expect the mainstream media to tell you that, though. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re too hung up on Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tweets to report that the president and his wife are changing the world as we speak.
