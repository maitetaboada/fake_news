President Donald Trump is done taking flack from the liberal loons in the Democratic Party for firing James Comey. Trump has never been one to sit back while under fire when he is just doing his job, so he went on the offensive and just gave Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and Maxine Waters a nasty surprise, making them look like fools. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll love how the president is getting sweet revenge, leaving his enemies utterly speechless. Democrats are the biggest hypocrites, and they proved that like never before with their reaction to the firing of now-former FBI Director James Comey. The ridiculous accusations, the fake outrage, and the cringeworthy narrative they are trying to sell the American people have reached levels of preposterous proportions. Trump, wanting to set the record straight on Comey, compiled a two-minute video and tweeted that out so all Americans could see just what a pack of rats they truly are. It especially hits Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and Maxine Waters hard since they have been some of the biggest critics, spewing lies about why Trump fired Comey. What‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s better, he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to say a word. He left them do the talking, and their own comments are biting them in the backside, big time. In fact, there was enough hypocritical comments from the left to put together a nice clip that drove the point home like nothing else could. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll love the short montage which ends with a new ‚Äoedrain the swamp‚Äù insignia. The Democrats should be ashamed. This is a disgrace!#DrainTheSwamp ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 11, 2017 Laura Ingraham, the radio host and lawyer who clerked for the Supreme Court, weighed in on what happened with Comey. ‚Äoe[Comey] did the non-indictment indictment of Hillary Clinton with the handling of the classified information, the private server. That was that bizarre press conference he did where he seemed to kind of convict her or charge her only to say, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>No, we couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t find the requisite intent that many say is really required under that statute,'‚Äù said Ingraham, according to Lifezette. We all remember Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 15-minute press conference where he laid out a perfect indictment of Hillary Clinton and then, in the end, refused to turn the case over the Department of Justice, where they could have convened a grand jury to decide if she should be indicted. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the FBI Director‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s role to make judgments about a case; it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s his job to gather the evidence and turn the case over to the Attorney General. Fox News host Sean Hannity also noted that Comey seemed astonishingly uninterested in investigating ‚Äoethe one crime we know‚Äù actually happened: the unmasking and leaking that contributed to former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s downfall. ‚ÄoeThe FBI hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even questioned [former acting Attorney General Sally] Yates about the one known crime in this case,‚Äù Hannity said. ‚ÄoeHow is that even possible?‚Äù Ingraham agreed, saying, ‚ÄoeYou have a crime that was committed, and the FBI director seems woefully uninterested, incurious about finding out what really went on.‚Äù Here is how insane the Democrats argument is about Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s motivation for firing Comey. They say Comey was hot on the trail of proving the Russians colluded with Trump during the election, so Trump had to fire him. Really? First off, there has been not one iota of evidence to come out of any investigation linking Trump to Russia. Secondly, so what if Comey is fired? Would that stop the counter-intel investigation from going on? If Comey had this mythical case against Trump, would he be the only one to know about it and would he take it with him and just let it go? Do you see how ridiculous this whole argument is? Yet, these liberal loons in the media are ratcheting up these talking points against Trump, and those Democratic idiots are right there, playing along. Well, no more. Patriotic Americans who have a brain aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t buying into their political game playing. While their heads are exploding over fake claims against President Donald Trump, we go on. We refused to buy their bullcrap during the election, and we are refusing to but it now. James Comey had to go; he screwed up time and time again, and now, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to move on. We stand with President Trump, and those fools in the Democratic party can whine all they want, we are winning with Trump and helping make America great again.
