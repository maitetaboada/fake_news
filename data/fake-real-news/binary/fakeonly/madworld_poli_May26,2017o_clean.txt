A breaking report about former FBI Director James Comey and a tremendous violation committed hundreds of times by the bureau under his leadership is rocking the nation as a Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court reveals exactly how he abused his position for the political benefit of the Obama administration. Wait until you see the evidence ‚Ä" this is about to get ugly. According to Circa News, recently declassified documents show that the FBI under James Comey, illegally shared raw intelligence about American citizens with unauthorized and even explicitly forbidden third parties. The report also shows that other constitutional privacy protections were repeatedly violated under Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s leadership despite the FBI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s public assurances about how it carefully handles warrantless spy data to prevent abuse or leaks. As Comey worked hand-in-hand with former President Barack Obama, who minimized the regulations on the intel community‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s power to spy on Americans, he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t careful enough to cover his tracks, and now, he has to answer for his obscene abuse of power. During an interview with Fox News on Thursday, May 25, 2017, Circa News reporter Sara Carter revealed that once-top secret U.S. intelligence community memos obtained by Circa, provide damning evidence of Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s reckless ‚Äoedisregard‚Äù for rules, inadequate training, and ‚Äoedeficient‚Äù oversight. In addition, the declassified documents show that the FBI deliberately shared spy data with a forbidden party. This bombshell report comes just weeks after Comey appeared before Congress for the last time to reassure lawmakers that the FBI used sensitive espionage data gathered about Americans without a warrant exclusively when it was ‚Äoelawfully collected, carefully overseen, and checked.‚Äù This was a complete lie, and Comey knew it. Circa‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s devastating report tells of a ruling, declassified earlier this month, by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) that clearly shows hundreds of violations of the Bureau‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s privacy-protecting minimization rules which took place under Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s direction. This is not circumstantial or speculative evidence. This is 10 pages of hard evidence against Comey and the Bureau provided by the FISA court which states that the FBI admitted to a FISA judge, in April 2017, that the FBI illegally shared raw intelligence with unauthorized third parties and accessed intercepted attorney-client private communications absent of proper oversight. To make matters worse, the FBI had promised years ago that the required oversight for these kinds of surveillance operations was already in place. Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the nail in the coffin for Comey. Included in the declassified ruling from the FISA court is a documented opinion that the FBI hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t yet revealed the full extent to which it violated the constitutional rights of Americans. The ruling said that the court fears there are more violations than the FBI has so far disclosed. ‚ÄoeThe Court is nonetheless concerned about the FBI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s apparent disregard of minimization rules and whether the FBI is engaging in similar disclosures of raw Section 702 information that have not been reported,‚Äù the April 2017 ruling declared. This disturbing revelation only proves how dangerous a man like James Comey can be to the foundations of our Democracy. He didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t act alone, and only a full investigation will reveal the extent of the FBI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s corruption. People need to wake up and realize that Comey abused his power for the benefit of Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s administration and for the detriment of his political enemies. The Department of Justice needs to make an example of Comey and all those who colluded with him to undermine our constitutional rights. Thank God, this despicable man is not in charge of the FBI any longer.
