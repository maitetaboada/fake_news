A few motorists in Texas were shocked to see something out of the ordinary while driving down a busy highway recently. As it turns out, someone decided to send a strong message by erecting a badass sign overnight ‚Ä" and all it took was 2 words to leave Trump-hating motorists foaming at the mouth. The sign was placed alongside the I-10 in San Antonio, Texas after one man had a stroke of genius. According to News 4 San Antonio, the billboard was rented by Kyle Courtney who lives in Boerne and was actually the result of the liberal aggression we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve seen over the past several months. As it turns out, Kyle was tired of the constant attacks on President Donald Trump and his supporters by the mainstream media. Fed up, he finally decided to do something, leaving a badass message for the world to read. Clearly seen in an image going viral on Twitter, the sign simply reads, ‚ÄoeABC News: I grew up with you. We are through. The Russians didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t elect Donald Trump. I did.‚Äù Billboard seen in Texas! üá®üá± ‚Ä" Cari Kelemen üá∫üá∏ () June 22, 2017 Of course, those last two words are enough to get under any liberal‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s skin as they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been beating the ‚Äoecollusion‚Äù drum since the election. Not only that, but they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve blamed foreign entities for their own failures, and it seems that the American people ‚Ä" as demonstrated by Kyle ‚Ä" have officially had enough. The billboard was paid for by Kyle, according to a spokesman for his company Wellstar Groundwater Technologies, and is set to remain there for about two months. Kyle has since released the following statement to the public: ‚ÄoeABC News was the only channel I watched as a child growing up in Texas but I think they have lost touch with America and forgotten the working man. They don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t represent our voice anymore. Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presidential campaign was funded by the Clinton Foundation in close coordination with the media, and now we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re seeing them try to fix what they couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fix during the election. They are doing everything they can, night after night, to create narratives and sway people‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s direction to impeach Donald Trump. Our democracy is at stake when a major political party and the media are in bed together. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not asking anyone to boycott the Democratic party. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not in the brainwashing business, but the liberal media is.‚Äù Too long have we had to listen to the mainstream media attack Trump at every turn and blame everything but the actual problem for their own failures. When it comes down to it, the biggest issue the left has to deal with is holding themselves accountable. Hillary was a horrible candidate ‚Ä" period. In fact, the only reason they saw her as a potential candidate is the fact that she has a vagina and they thought that would outweigh all the negative and criminal aspects that she brought with her. Too bad for them, it didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. Democrats in this country have a lot of self-reflection to do if they really want to start winning elections in this country. As we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve seen, all they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been good at lately is spending millions of dollars to lose elections. Of course, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re still hellbent on telling everyone that their candidate is going to win ‚Ä" but that has yet to happen. The best thing they can do for themselves at this point is to get out of their little bubble and start looking at the truth for what it is. Lying isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t doing them any favors at this point, and the mainstream media is making that perfectly clear.
