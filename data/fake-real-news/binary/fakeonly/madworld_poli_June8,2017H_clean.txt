Although President Donald Trump has been in the White House for several months now, the First Lady had stayed in New York as Barron finished the school year. Now, Melania has recently decided to make a move that will force the White House to adapt, including her husband, and it will undoubtedly change everything. President Trump and Melania seem to have a unique relationship. Melania being the only First Lady who didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t immediately move into the White House only proves the importance both place on the individual needs of the other, as well as their child. However, things are about to change as Melania has finally made the announcement we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve all been waiting to hear, and the White House will need to adjust as she and Barron are officially moving in on June 14th. Their move has been long-anticipated. Barron has recently finished his final year of school at Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School in New York and will be starting classes at St Andrew‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Episcopal School in Potomac, Maryland, this fall, according to Daily Mail. In addition to this drastic change for the First Family, Melania‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s parents, Victor and Amalija Knavs, have also announced that they will be spending more time in Washington, D.C., to help care for 11-year-old Barron. Of course, Melania anticipates being busy, building her East Wing Staff and preparing the home for her family over the next week. ‚ÄoeMrs. Trump is honored to serve this country and is taking the role and responsibilities of the First Lady very seriously,‚Äù her senior adviser Stephanie Wolkoff revealed. So, for all the liberal whiners who have taken it upon themselves to complain about the First Lady and Barron ‚Äoewasting taxpayer money‚Äù by living at their home in the Trump Tower penthouse in Manhattan, they can finally shut their mouths. As Melania has said in the past, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s moving to D.C. now that her son can permanently come with her without being uprooted from school. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no doubt that Melania‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s permanent presence alongside President Trump will benefit him greatly and perhaps positively influence him. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m very happy she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s moving here,‚Äù said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign aide who has spent time with the couple, according to Politico. ‚ÄoeShe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a strong influence and personality, and I think she comforts him.‚Äù Although Melania has made it clear that she doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t intervene with how her husband leads the nation, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no doubt he looks to her for support ‚Ä" as any husband would do. In fact, Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, a longtime Mar-a-Lago member and Trump confidant, explained, ‚ÄoeI do think Donald listens to his wife and respects her opinions on things tremendously.‚Äù So, I think it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s safe to say, things in the White House are about to change for the better. Without a doubt, the White House will be adapting to the new arrivals. A family can only spend so long apart before they need to make a change and be together. Thankfully, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only been a few months. The trio can now become whole again, and our nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s White House is exactly how it should be. Although President Trump has handled himself well over the past few months, every leader needs his support system, and they all need to be under the same roof.
