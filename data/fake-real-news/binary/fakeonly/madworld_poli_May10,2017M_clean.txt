Stephen Colbert, the liberal late-night talk show host, is finding out the hard way what happens when you cross President Donald Trump. Colbert got a huge reality check on a recent show when started talking about James Comey and his audience answered his monolog with a nasty surprise, and it was all caught on live TV. Stephen Colbert became unhinged during the opening of his May 2nd broadcast. Apparently, Colbert has a deep abiding love for journalist John Dickerson who hosts ‚ÄoeFace the Nation‚Äù and had just interviewed President Trump. It seems Colbert can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take a joke as he took immediate issue with Trump calling Dickerson‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s show ‚ÄoeDeface the Nation.‚Äù Since John Dickerson apparently can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stand up himself, Colbert did it for him and used his show to give his profane monolog on Trump. Colbert has joined the ranks of most celebs who are turning their platforms into bully pulpits. No longer do they entertain. No, they see themselves as deep thinkers and excoriate anyone who does not share their socialist-globalist values, and Colbert‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tirade proved just that. ‚ÄoeMr. President, I love your presidency, I call it ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Disgrace The Nation.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not the POTUS, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>gloat-us.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re the glutton with the button. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re a regular ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Gorge Washington.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>presi-dunce‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> but you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re turning into a real ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>prick-tator,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>‚Äù Colbert said during the now-infamous opening monolog. If you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re thinking, ‚Äoewhat a jackass,‚Äù you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re thinking the same thing as patriots across the country. In fact, Colbert got a rude awakening about just how many Trump fans are out there. While the majority of people who watch a Stephen Colbert show are probably liberals, there is still a modicum of truth that most Americans on either side of the political aisle believe, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s where Colbert made his big mistake on his most recent show. Colbert came out and announced, ‚ÄoeHuge story that just broke minutes ago, like ten minutes ago, FBI Director James Comey is fired by Trump.‚Äù The audience erupted with applause and some were hollering wildly, proving that the truth of just how bad Comey was is felt by all Americans, and that got Colbert pissed off. He is so arrogant, he chastised his own audience for their reaction. He then tried to explain to them why they need to not celebrate the firing of Comey, but he only came off like the big jerk he is. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll love the look on his face as the applause begins. Tonight! Stephen reacts to the day's big surprise: the firing of James Comey by President Trump. #LSSC d ‚Ä" The Late Show () May 10, 2017 Other Americans reacted on Twitter, letting Colbert know that Trump is getting the last laugh on this one. The Colbert audience cheering wildly when they hear Comey was fired is pretty priceless. ‚Ä" Mark Hemingway () May 10, 2017 You actually chastised the crowd for giving the reaction you've trained into them for the past 6 months. ‚Ä" Jim Treacher () May 10, 2017 COLBERT: Trump fired ComeyNY AUDIENCE: YEAAAAAAAAAAAHCOLBERT: No guys, this is bad. Here's some awful jokes to explain why.AUDIENCE: Boo? ‚Ä" Josh Jordan () May 10, 2017 When will these idiot celebs stop playing politics and go back to entertaining? Can you imagine if you decided to not do your job but started doing whatever you wanted to do instead? Right, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be fired, and if these nutjobs aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t careful, they will lose what little ratings they have. What happened on Colbert‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s show is exactly how the Hollywood crowd influences liberals to think the way they do. The audience claps at first because they are thinking for themselves, and then, Colbert gets incensed and tells them what they should think. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pathetic. Thankfully, there are those of us who elected President Donald Trump, and we refuse to be brainwashed. Stephen Colbert is a sad little man who has crappy ratings, and after adding this embarrassment to his disgusting monolog, I predict his late night show might be history soon.
