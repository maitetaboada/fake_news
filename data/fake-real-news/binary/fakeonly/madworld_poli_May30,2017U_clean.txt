First Lady Melania Trump has received a lot of criticism from the liberal losers ever since her husband took office. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s endured questions about her marriage and about her son, but she has taken it all in stride. Who can forget the celebrity fashion designers who refused to ‚Äoedress‚Äù her when they fawned all over Michelle Obama. Well, all of that has come to an end as Melania just got big revenge on all of them. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll love this. Supporters of President Donald Trump were aghast that famous fashion designers, who always dress the First Lady, publicly tried to shame Melania Trump by saying they would not dress her and that they did not want her to wear their designs. Melania, who everyone knows started out as a professional model, remained silent to all of the criticism. Michelle Obama received lavish free designer dresses and outfits from all of the most famous couture companies, and you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d think she would have been big enough to tell her designer friends to cool it when it came to Melania. But, in true Obama form, she relished in Melania‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s embarrassment and loved that she was still the one on the cover of Vogue Magazine. Well, Michelle Obama is out, and Melania Trump is in. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right, after Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s debacle in Europe, wearing ill-fitting tops and clothes that looked like she got them from her teenage daughter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s closet, the fashion designers have turned on her. Those same fashion designers are now begging to dress Melania after she showed them on her trip abroad that even though they hate her husband‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s politics, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a dream come true for them. That word came down officially as Melania made ‚ÄoePage Six‚Äù with the headline, ‚ÄoeMelania Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>revenge‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> on designers who won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t dress her.‚Äù ‚ÄoeThere is a softening, a melting,‚Äù said stylist Phillip Bloch. ‚ÄoeFashion people are fickle and fake. They are starting to see she is a beautiful woman who is married to the president, and it is an honor to dress her.‚Äù Deliveries to Trump Tower have picked up. ‚ÄoeMost days, the lobby is brimming with wardrobe boxes delivered for Melania,‚Äù a source told Bloch. ‚ÄoeOnce she tries on the outfits and decides what she will keep, the boxes come back downstairs.‚Äù But, the biggest slight to Michelle came by what the famous fashion designers can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t deny; they are proclaiming that Melania Trump is one of the classiest First Lady‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ever to grace the White House. Melania has been named as one in the very small exclusive club, along with Jackie Kennedy and Nancy Reagan, by famous designers. ‚ÄoeNot since Jacqueline Kennedy has there been a first lady who needs less help. She doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t need couture. She can buy off the rack, and it looks beautiful,‚Äù Bloch said. ‚ÄoeShe knows her size, and she knows what works on her. She luxuriates in minimal.‚Äù These designers never said anything close to that about Michelle Obama. Even though the liberals tried so hard to transform Michelle into a fashion icon, it never worked. Many in the liberal press were gushing over Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tragic outfits in Italy when we all knew she had dressed all wrong. She got jeered by Italians and Americans alike for wearing this strange top (seen below) into a 12th-century Cathedral as she ignored the guidelines for no bare shoulders. This was one of the last straws for the designers who couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t cover for her anymore. Notice it says ‚Äoeclass,‚Äù in the Instagram description. It was anything but classy and like the emperor with no clothes, those idiots who back the Obamas cheered this fashion disaster. Two things you can't buy‚Ä¶.. 1) CLASS 2) PEACE OF MIND‚Ä¶ #GlowUp #MichelleObama #MelaninPoppin #FLOTUS A post shared by Jerica Phillips () on May 24, 2017 at 5:55am PDT It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nice to know our First Lady is finally getting the respect she so deserves. But, for those of us who have been in her corner from day one, we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t need the rich and famous to tell us Melania has class; we have known that all along. We are very proud, though, that she is now recognized along with Jackie Kennedy as one of the classiest First Lady‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s of modern times. That is a true honor for Melania Trump.
