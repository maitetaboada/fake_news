All eyes were on First Lady Melania Trump as she arrived at the Vatican, especially after Michelle Obama had just been spotted in Italy disrespecting Christian holy sites. Italians were aghast yesterday at Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s behavior, but today, as Melania stepped from her vehicle at the Vatican, Italians were cheering. You will be too when you see how she just restored America‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dignity in Italy while teaching Michelle a big lesson she won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t forget. Melania Trump stepped from her vehicle at the Vatican with the president at her side, wearing all black with a beautiful veil on her head as is the custom. Ivanka Trump also wore a veil, looking stunning in black as they met Pope Francis. Melania, who is Catholic, chose the more traditional Spanish-style ‚Äoemantilla‚Äù veil. Melania was also able to show off her linguistic skills when the Pope struck up a conversation with her in Italian. ‚ÄoeWhat do you give him to eat?‚Äù the Pope asked her in Italian, referring to President Donald Trump. He then suggested, ‚ÄoePotizza?‚Äù which is a Slovenian treat. First Lady Melania reportedly responded with delight and laughed. After their light-hearted exchange, Melania asked the Pope to bless her rosary. The optics of Americans respecting the rules of decent dress was sorely needed after Michelle Obama humiliated herself at a Siena cathedral just the day before. Unfortunately, the world still sees Michelle Obama as an American leader, and she deliberately disrespected the customs and the Christian faith with her postage stamp size top which was falling off of her as she walked. The only dress code at Duomo di Siena is no bare shoulders and shorts/skirts below the knee. Michelle Obama wears this. c ‚Ä" Margie üá∫üá∏ () May 23, 2017 The liberal Hollywood Life website weighed in, shockingly agreeing that Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s top was all wrong, saying that ‚Äoethis look was a little more risque than those we normally see Michelle in, with little strings used in lieu of sleeves to keep the shirt together on her sides. So it is up for debate whether it is the right outfit for Michelle or not.‚Äù It was a truly cringeworthy scene, and one that the Italians saw as a clear sign of disrespecting Jesus Christ. Anyone who has visited cathedrals in Italy knows about the dress code, and there is no doubt Michelle Obama knew what she was doing as a world traveler. The dress codes are visible at the cathedral doors. Liberal loons are accusing Melania of wearing a veil at the Vatican while she did not wear a hijab in Saudi Arabia. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a big difference. Wearing a hijab in Islam has everything to do with covering up a woman so others can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see her. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s something they are mandated to do in Islamic countries as women have no rights. Mr. Willey, a BBC fashion critic, was particularly impressed with Mrs. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s choice of outfit, where other mainstream media outlets were screeching about her trip to Saudi Arabia and not wearing the hijab. Willey said, ‚ÄoeTo my eyes, what Mrs. Trump wore was perfect. She was rather elegantly dressed, and totally in keeping with the event. The Trump party [as a whole] observed normal protocol and dress.‚Äù Melania Trump has gained the love and respect of the Italian people. In her quiet way and with her fashion sense, she showed the world that not all Americans are as uncouth and as unclassy as the Obamas. We owe her a debt of gratitude for representing America in the best possible light, erasing the undignified behavior of Michelle and replacing it with the grace of a Christian mother and wife.
