Gal Gadot, the actress who stars as ‚ÄoeWonder Woman,‚Äù is under fire by the Hollywood critics and liberal feminists snowflakes, like Ashley Judd. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re appalled that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s portraying a strong female superhero after they learned her role in ‚Äoekicking ISIS a**‚Äù in real life. The Hollywood feminists are hoping to influence ticket sales as the movie premieres across the country by calling for a boycott, and they hope you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re too stupid to find out why. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve uncovered the truth of Gal Gadot past and her role in fighting Islamic terrorism. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to love this. Gal Gadot is a thirty-two-year-old actress who was born in Israel. Like all Israelis, she joined the Israeli Defense Forces and was singled out for her physical strength and agility to become a combat trainer. During her time in the military, she came face to face with the horrors of the Islamic State and their evil partners Hamas and Hezbollah. She fought and watched her friends die at the hands of these barbarians. The Hollywood crowd, the critics, and feminists see Gadot‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s conservative beliefs as horrendous, and they are calling for a boycott of her new film, Wonder Woman. ‚ÄoeThe Campaign to Boycott Supporters of Israel-Lebanon has cited Gadot‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s association with the Israeli army ‚Ä" where she served a mandatory two years ‚Ä" as a reason to outlaw the film in Lebanon,‚Äù reports Vanity Fair. But, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not all. Now, there are the rabid feminists who are melting down as the leftist Huffington Post reports, ‚Äoe[S]he posted a picture on her own Facebook page of herself, praying with her daughter Alma. While many Israeli stars have come forward to plead for an end to the bloodshed, it was Gal‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s caption that caught attention.‚Äù So, what was so offensive in Gadot‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s caption? As you check out her post below, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be completely blown away that these nutjobs see this as ‚Äoewrong.‚Äù It seems these idiots can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stand a strong woman who believes in defending her country from Muslim terrorists. But, we shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be surprised since feminists like Ashely Judd are on the record opposing the legitimacy of the Jewish state.

Especially to all the boys and girls who are risking‚Ä¶ Posted by Gal Gadot on Friday, July 25, 2014 Liberals are also pissed off that she spoke of her military training as a positive experience in getting her ready to play Wonder Woman. ‚ÄoeIn a series of Facebook posts, the Campaign to Boycott Supporters of Israel-Lebanon accused Gadot of boasting ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>about the army training her for Hollywood.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s almost a direct quote with Gadot telling Fashion magazine in 2015: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>The army wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t that difficult for me. The military gave me good training for Hollywood.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> The post also condemns Gadot for supporting the Israeli army‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s controversial 2014 invasion of Gaza,‚Äù reports Vanity Fair. The anti-Israel and the feminist crowd weighed in, spreading all kinds of falsehoods about Gal Gadot and the Jews. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d almost have to say these people are anti-Semitic and anti-American, too. gal gadot is a zionist who was in the israel defense forces, supporting palestinian deaths. fuck outta here with ur white feminism ‚Ä" emily annette () June 5, 2017 Pretty ironic that Wonder Woman is supposed to represent feminism when Gal Gadot supports the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians by Israel. ‚Ä" queer space prole () May 30, 2017 When you want Wonder Woman to succeed but also Gal Gadot is an ex-combat trainer from Israel that supports the occupation of Palestine. ‚Ä" Vanessa Umanzor () May 25, 2017 Wow, Gal Gadot was a combat trainer and she supports her country‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right to exist, and for that, the rats call for a boycott. Gal Gadot is proud that she helped ‚Äoekick ISIS a**‚Äù and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s proud of her faith and country. Compared to the female celebrities like Ashley Judd, Katy Perry, Cher, Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell, and Madonna, just to name a few who hate America and hate that our country is out to eliminate the Islamic State, Gal Gadot is someone your kids can look up to. She is a true Israeli patriot and hero. The sick Hollywood crowd and the useful idiots that follow their every word should all go and spend six months in the Middle East. They wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t last a week; they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d either get stoned or thrown off a building. We support Gal Gadot. Finally, a real woman hero playing a woman superhero, and as for the boycott, Americans stopped listening to the politically correct liberal loons when we elected President Donald Trump.
