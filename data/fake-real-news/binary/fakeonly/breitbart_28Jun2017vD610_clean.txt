However, original cast member Jordana Brewster, who plays Mia Toretto and was the love interest of the late Paul Walker‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s character, did not appear in The Fate of the Furious. Brewster told Fox News in April that her departure from the blockbuster franchise wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a choice.‚Äù ‚ÄoeI didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t say goodbye,‚Äù she said. In a May interview with Entertainment Weekly, Rodriguez described Brewster‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disappearance from Fast as ‚Äoepathetic.‚Äù ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been making movies with Jordana, who plays the sister of Dom Toretto, for 16 years and I can count on one hand how many lines I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve had to her,‚Äù she said. Rodriguez and Vin Diesel are the two remaining original cast members. The latest Fast film was a star-studded and male-domiatied outing, featuring an ensemble cast including Dwayne Johnson, Kurt Russell, Tyrese Gibson, Jason Statham, and Chris ‚ÄoeLudacris‚Äù Bridges. ‚ÄoeAt the end of the day, the only leverage I have as an individual is my participation,‚Äù Rodriguez said. ‚ÄoeThat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the only leverage I ever use with anything.‚Äù F.
