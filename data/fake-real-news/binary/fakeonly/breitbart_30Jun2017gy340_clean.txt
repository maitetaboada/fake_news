In December 2015, Pedro Figueroa-Zarceno, an illegal alien from El Salvador, had his car stolen and subsequently went to the local police station to recover the vehicle. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were contacted, as police were made aware that Figueroa-Zarceno was an illegal alien, according to CBS News. Figueroa-Zarceno was ordered to be deported back in 2005, but he has defied the order. In 2012, the illegal alien was convicted and imprisoned for drunk driving. While Figueroa-Zarceno was taken into custody by ICE, he and his lawyers said his detention violated San Francisco‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s controversial sanctuary city laws, which mandates that illegal aliens, no matter their criminal history, be shielded from immigration law enforcement. The illegal alien was detained by ICE for two months, but his attorneys are now expected to win him $190,000 settlement, which taxpayers will foot the bill. According to Figueroa-Zarceno‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attorneys, the San Francisco Police Department violated sanctuary city laws by allegedly cooperating with ICE to inform them of the illegal alien‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s status and past run-ins with the law. The San Francisco Police Department is advocating for the settlement with the illegal alien. ‚ÄoeSan Francisco has strong policies in place to encourage victims and witnesses to report crimes without fear of being deported, which include our sanctuary ordinance,‚Äù San Francisco City Attorney spokesman John Cot√© said. ‚ÄoeThese policies are designed to foster respect and trust between law enforcement and residents to ensure our communities are safe. The City, including the Police Department, remain committed to them.‚Äù ‚ÄoeThis proposed settlement is a fair resolution for all of the parties involved,‚Äù Cot√© said.
