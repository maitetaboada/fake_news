Last Friday, President Donald Trump embarked on his first overseas trip while in office. Having now returned to the United States with First Lady Melania, he was seen bringing one thing back with him, and the media doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want you to know about it. While most presidents travel to Canada or Mexico for their initial foreign visit, Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s trip was far more significant. His first stop was Saudi Arabia, where he and Melania, accompanied by their entourage, received a welcome befitting of a king. According to Young Conservatives, it was in Saudi Arabia that Trump did something unmatched by any of his predecessors, securing ‚Äoehundreds of billions of dollars‚Äù for the U.S. from the Middle East via a ground-breaking $110 billion arms deal. The arms transaction is intended to bolster national security in Saudi Arabia as well as the country‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ability to combat terrorism. The White House says the agreement will provide fighter jets, tanks, radar, combat ships and anti-missile defense systems to Saudi Arabia and will create defense-related jobs in the U.S. The defense cooperation agreements signed Saturday offer the Saudis $110 billion immediately, and ultimately worth $350 billion over the next decade. In total, Trump signed eight letters of acceptance and one letter of intent said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. Also signed was a joint vision statement and private sector agreements.

Bringing hundreds of billions of dollars back to the U.S.A. from the Middle East ‚Ä" which will mean JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 27, 2017 Indeed, Trump has already cemented himself as the leading job creator of any president in recent history. Just a few months into his term, it is an overwhelmingly refreshing shift from what Americans experienced over the last eight years with Barack Obama at the helm of the country. If a Democratic president had returned from a week abroad with $110 billion for the United States‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> economy, they would ceremoniously be hailed a hero by the media and the left. But, have you heard anything from CNN or MSNBC about this monumental accomplishment made by Trump? I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think so. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the press will place an agenda over their job, which is to legitimately report the news without political bias. Sadly, it seems journalism is all but dead in the United States of America. But, luckily, thanks to Trump, jobs aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ‚Ä" just don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait for the leftist media to tell you about it.
