Former FBI Director James Comey is making headlines after a memo he wrote was leaked to the press. The alleged story is that Comey jotted down the memo after President Donald Trump asked him to ‚Äoego easy‚Äù on Lt. Gen. Micheal Flynn, and the Democrats are saying that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s obstruction of justice, causing cries for impeachment. Luckily, Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s got the truth on his side, and he gave Comey a nasty surprise, as the whole scheme backfires big time. James Comey is a sore loser who, after being fired by President Trump, is now linked to leaking an alleged memo that he wrote to himself after a meeting with the president on February 14. This memo was conveniently leaked to the failing New York Times, and the liberal loons are hoping it would prove Trump was ‚Äoeobstructing justice‚Äù in the Gen. Flynn investigation. A ‚Äoeheavily suspect‚Äù report from the New York Times, based on anonymous sources, says, ‚ÄoePresident Trump asked the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to shut down the federal investigation into Mr. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in an Oval Office meeting in February, according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meeting. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I hope you can let this go,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> the president told Mr. Comey, according to the memo.‚Äù Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s where the NY Times slants this alleged memo to infer that Trump should be impeached: ‚ÄoeThe existence of Mr. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s request is the clearest evidence that the president has tried to directly influence the Justice Department and F.B.I. investigation into links between Mr. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s associates and Russia.‚Äù However, Trump has a nasty surprise for Comey and the nutjobs who are trying so hard to ratchet up scandal after scandal to impeach him, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a reality check on their latest scheme. If Comey jotted down a memo that no one has seen to date, and if this memo exists, then Comey either neglected to act on this so-called ‚Äoeobstruction of justice‚Äù by Trump, which means he broke the law, or he is involved in leaking bogus information as a payback to being fired. It has to be one or the other, which means Comey is facing charges or he is outed as a leaker. Under the law, Comey is required to immediately inform the Department of Justice of any attempt to obstruct justice by any person, even the President of the United States. Failure to do so would result in criminal charges against Comey. (18 USC 4 and 28 USC 1361) He would also, upon sufficient proof, lose his license to practice law. [Source: Fox News] Also, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s clear evidence that Trump has done nothing wrong, and this is all a scam. Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s temporary replacement, Andrew McCabe, denied there was anything impeding investigations at the FBI. He testified last week, ‚ÄoeThere has been no effort to impede our investigation to date.‚Äù As The Right Scoop reports, ‚ÄoeSo you remember when McCabe said last week that there had been NO efforts to interfere with the Russia investigation? If Comey had shared those memos with the top officials at the FBI, wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t McCabe have known about it when he gave his answer? So who is lying?‚Äù Well, of course, Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lying, and those idiots in the mainstream media have tried and failed again to take out Trump. Are we to believe Comey had this huge case of obstruction of justice by the sitting President of the United States and just sat on it? Or is it more likely that Comey is attempting some payback against Trump and leaked this memo who no one can validate except Comey? Laura Ingraham, radio host and well-known attorney who clerked for the Supreme Court, weighed in on Twitter, and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s proving why Trump is getting the last laugh on Comey. Comey writes memos after mtg claiming Trump wanted Flynn invest shut down ‚Ä"yet he doesn't tell AG or Dep AG, but keeps ace up sleeve? ‚Ä" Laura Ingraham () May 16, 2017 Did Comey as FBI Dir immed walk out of his mtg with Trump after he allegedly asked invest to be ended? If not, why not? ‚Ä" Laura Ingraham () May 16, 2017 Comey's withholding such key information from AG or Dep AG is deeply disturbing. Petulant payback time. ‚Ä" Laura Ingraham () May 16, 2017 The leftist media is unhinged about this Comey memo story. They are giddy, thinking they really have something with this alleged memo, but the truth is, they have a big fat nothing burger. However, one thing is clear, and that is these leaks have got to stop. Americans are sick and tired of these liberals in the press who are obsessed with taking out Trump. Instead of focusing on creating jobs, tax reform, and securing our border, these leaks disrupt Congress and undermine the president whom we elected to do the job that we know he can do. These are un-American vermin who are still pissed off that Hillary Clinton lost, and they could care less about the welfare of the American people. James Comey and his cohorts are the rats leaking this nonsense to the press, and they must be stopped and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. American patriots see through their lies as we support Donald Trump who is draining the swamp of these Barack Obama holdovers. Nothing will stand in the way of making America great again.
