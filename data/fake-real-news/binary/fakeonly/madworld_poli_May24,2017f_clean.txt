Shocking news has come out of Washington, D.C. after an appointee of former President Barack Obama abruptly resigned after 7 years. As it turns out, he was supposed to testify before Congress tomorrow but chose to quit rather than face the music ‚Ä" and now, we know the damning reason why. The Obama administration was perhaps the most destructive our country has ever seen. Between excessive spending and policies that don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t align with American standards, well, to say that Barack Obama was the direct reason President Donald Trump was elected would be a bit of an understatement. However, it seems that the lasting effects of Obama are still lingering, and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve most recently seen that in the Department of Education. According to Young Conservatives, James Runcie, chief operating officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid, quit his job without warning, just one day before he was scheduled to testify before Congress. As one would imagine, the shocking coincidence has raised more than a few eyebrows as people immediately began to speculate that he had something to hide. Come to find out, they were exactly right. James Runcie, chief operating officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid, ‚Äoesubmitted his resignation to the department last night,‚Äù effective immediately, the agency said in a press release. Runcie had been slated to testify on Thursday before the House Oversight Committee regarding the department‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rising improper payment rate for federal student aid programs. [Source: Politico] A memo was also obtained, in which Runcie outlined the reason for his abrupt resignation. Come to find out, he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to answer for the improper payments on behalf of his department: ‚ÄoeI have been consistently on record and clear about not testifying at the upcoming hearing on improper payments,‚Äù Runcie wrote in the resignation letter, adding that he had ‚Äoenot heard a single compelling reason‚Äù the department would need him to testify. [Source: Buzzfeed] Of course, common sense would indicate that if he had nothing to hide, then he wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have any problem answering a few questions from Congress. However, he instead was so adamant on not appearing before Congress that he chose to quit rather than show up, hinting toward the fact that he may have been involved in some unethical or nefarious practices. Sadly, this was all part of Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s plan ‚Ä" to leave behind a cancerous crew that would slowly try to rot Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presidency from the inside out. Too bad for Obama, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s quickly learning that his plan isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really working. In fact, records indicate that there was a constant tension between Runcie and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, meaning that his days there were numbered anyway. Obama was and always will be remembered for the infection that he was to this nation. However, what he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t account for is how resilient America is. We successfully elected President Donald Trump, and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve more than expressed our wishes to undo the past 8 horrendous years. This country has shown that it knows how to get rid of a dangerous infection ‚Ä" we cut it out. And, on that note, we say ‚Äoegood riddance‚Äù to the hindrance that was Mr. Runcie. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nice when the trash takes itself out.
