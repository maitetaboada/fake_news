A reporter recently bit off a bit more than he could chew after getting a few moments to hurl questions at Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Unfortunately for the smug liberal, things would go wrong the moment he asked one stupid question ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about the time he learned how the General got the nickname ‚ÄoeMad Dog.‚Äù It all started when Mattis appeared for an interview with CBS ‚ÄoeFace the Nation‚Äù host John Dickerson. Of course, most people knew that something spectacular was about to happen, but they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what. Sure enough, the General would leave both the reporter and the audience watching in utter disbelief. For those unaware, the wide-ranging interview included a flurry of questions about the number of threats currently facing America, like unrest in the Middle East, the Islamic State, and North Korea. However, the best was yet to come when Dickerson actually had the gall to ask Mattis, ‚ÄoeWhat keeps you awake at night.‚Äù As seen in the video shared to Live Leak, ‚ÄoeMad Dog‚Äù showed the reporter how he got his nickname by looking him square in the eye and dishing out an epic response. Without skipping a beat or batting an eye, Mattis simply said, ‚ÄoeNothing. I keep other people awake at night.‚Äù Of course, viewers watching at home immediately shot out of their seats and started cheering, but this answer really shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t surprise us when it comes to Mattis. After all, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just another in a long line of incredible statements released by the man over time, like these: As one would imagine, social media users were quick to cheer for Mattis: Guns carry Mattis for protection. ‚Ä" Jen Goode () May 28, 2017 Full Mattis Jacket ‚Ä" Sergio CCCP () May 28, 2017 I was kept awake at night the last 8 years, from an incompetent pres.

Take that into consideration with the fact that Mattis has been doing it all his life, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no wonder the man isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t scared of a damn thing. Even better yet, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s absolutely right ‚Ä" he should be feared. When it comes down to it, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s speaking about America as a whole when he says we aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t afraid of anything, or at least we shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be ‚Ä" not with him in charge. Furthermore, what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s to be scared of when you know the enemy is shaking in their boots as the full force of the American military continues to destroy them from every side? It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no wonder they lay awake at night. It takes a special kind of guy to just speak the first thing that comes to mind, especially in this day and age. However, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly that reason that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s captured the love of so many across the country. Even better yet, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the perfect addition to President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s team when it comes to kicking butt. If ever there was a man I would want to protect this country, Mattis is surely it.
