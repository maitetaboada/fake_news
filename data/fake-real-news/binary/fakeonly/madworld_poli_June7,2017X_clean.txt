Several Americans thought that Ted Cruzâ€<sup>TM</sup>s plan to use El Chapoâ€<sup>TM</sup>s seized drug money to build President Donald Trumpâ€<sup>TM</sup>s border wall was a great idea, but it doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t look like thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s happening. Unfortunately for the liberals who thought that this meant the end of Trumpâ€<sup>TM</sup>s wall, they couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have been more wrong. In fact, theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re really going to hate the newest funding idea to raise the needed $21 billion. Our exposed border has been an issue for America for quite some time. However, that reality was made even worse by former President Barack Obama after he decided to hamstring Border Patrol agents and not enforce immigration laws. Of course, with President Donald Trump now in office, illegal aliens are running scared as deportations are increasing. Along with that, Trump is trying to make sure that as few criminals as possible are allowed back into the country â€" and thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s where the wall comes in. Unfortunately, there seems to be one small hiccup in the idea, and thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s the cost, coming in at $12 to $15 billion to complete with some estimates reaching as high as $21 billion. Although Trump has said that heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s going to make Mexico pay for the wall, weâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve yet to see that happen, which has prompted a few others to come up with alternative ways for what they believe to be a necessity. In fact, Ted Cruz made national headlines after he suggested that the seized funds of Mexican drug kingpin El Chapo could pay for the wall â€" and with good reason. After all, what better way to keep drugs out of our country than using a criminalâ€<sup>TM</sup>s money to pay for a wall keeping them out? Sadly, it looks like that wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t ideal for many people, but that hasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t stopped the ideas from coming in. As it turns out, someone else just came up with a $21 billion idea, and heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s since come forward with his proposed plan. .: #SanctuaryCities should foot the bill for border wall. #Tucker â€" Fox News () June 7, 2017 Appearing on Tucker Carlsonâ€<sup>TM</sup>s show on FOX News, Alabama Senator Luther Strange said that the funds should come directly from so-called sanctuary cities, which donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t follow the law. In short, federal funds would be stripped from cities that arenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t obeying the law as President Trump previously discussed, but this way, it would be used to prevent that which theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re trying to enable. In a bizarre twist of fate, it seems that the GOP has come up with an even better way to pay for the wall. Now, the funds wonâ€<sup>TM</sup>t be stripped from seized funds but rather will be used to teach leftist, who feel as if the law is voluntary, a very severe lesson. Of course, weâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve already heard liberal leaders of these cities start to bash Trump over the decision and even threaten to withhold taxes in retaliation, but Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>d like to see Califonia go up against the Federal Government. What are they going to use as weapons now that theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve taken away nearly all the guns â€" dildos and bongs? The left better get things straight â€" this country is headed in a new direction whether they like it or not. Although liberals donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t like to admit it, President Donald Trump has the support of a large portion of this country, and one way or another, this wall will get built. At this point, they either need to get out of the way or get run over by the Trump train. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s as simple as that.
