It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no secret that liberals will over exaggerate and say whatever is necessary to try to make President Donald Trump look bad. However, their most recent cry for attention has resulted in an uproar on social media after they caught what Trump did at Arlington Cemetery during the Memorial Day ceremony. As many of us were celebrating Memorial Day, our Commander-in-Chief, along with Vice President Mike Pence and General James Mattis, was seen at Arlington National Cemetery, paying their respects to United States servicemembers who have made the ultimate sacrifice. However, liberals were left in an uproar over what they caught Trump doing during the opening ceremony, which they find totally unnecessary ‚Ä" singing along to our National Anthem, ‚ÄoeThe Star-Spangled Banner.‚Äù Whiny brats across the country decided to attack President Trump solely because he proudly sang along to the national anthem. However, his singing wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the only ‚Äoeoffensive‚Äù part to these liberal whiners. Some were even more livid that he stopped singing at one point. Towards the end of the anthem, Trump decided to stop singing and listen, resulting in Twitter lighting up with outrage, as leftists assumed that Trump had done something unthinkable and ‚Äoeforgotten the words‚Äù to our National Anthem, according to Pix 11. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s clear that Trump is in a ‚Äoedamned if you do, damned if you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t‚Äù situation with the liberal left. If he sings, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attacked. If he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sing, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attacked. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ridiculous. And come on ‚Ä" it's our National Anthem and you can't even commit your time and effort to learning the words!? SAD!!! ‚Ä" jennifer p () May 29, 2017 Hahaha trump‚Ä¶he forgot words to Star Spangled Banner, making big show singing along. At least he tried ‚Ä" Lori King () May 29, 2017 As trump bops his way during a solemn ceremony, singing and making an idiot out of himself, I am embarrassed for this country. Beyond sad. ‚Ä" Howard resist Trump () May 29, 2017 One could only imagine the praise former President Barack Obama would have received for singing along to the National Anthem. Unfortunately, we live in a nation where the media only sees and reports what they want with their own left-leaning spin, even if it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a blatant lie. Of course, we must forget the fact that Obama could barely handle putting his hand on his heart, but according to the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s standards, proudly singing along is just appalling. Thankfully, there were a few Trump supporters willing to put these brats in their place, proving once and for all that a proud President isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the worst thing in the world. The melodramatic attacks on everything trump does is transparent and disgusting. Nothing wrong with singing the national anthem at Arlington ‚Ä" Dan Raunig () May 29, 2017 I am not even close to being a fan of Trump, but what's wrong with your president singing your national anthem? ‚Ä" Jeff White () May 29, 2017 It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s obvious that Trump was merely singing the tune because of his love for America, but every whiny liberal would rather report that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoedisgusting‚Äù and ‚Äoedisrespectful‚Äù to sing the way Trump had ‚Ä" as if there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a right and a wrong way to belt out ‚ÄoeThe Star-Spangled Banner.‚ÄùAlthough the liberals of our nation continue to lie, exaggerate, and cause an uproar over ridiculous things, one thing is for certain ‚Ä" our nation is already on its way to being great again, and we have President Donald Trump to thank for that. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s refreshing to have a man leading our nation who genuinely loves his country and its citizens. Not only are we no longer in a downward spiral, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re actually beginning to bounce back to greatness. Perhaps our children will have the opportunity to know what it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s like to live in a powerful country and to know what patriotism truly means.
