‚ÄoeDemocrats are saying it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to go, arguing that losses in this year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s special congressional elections show that their party needs new, younger leadership,‚Äù the article accompanying the poll results states. ‚ÄoeMost Democrats agree.‚Äù The national poll done by telephone and online and published on Monday found that only 31 percent of likely Democratic voters believe the current national leadership represents them. By contrast, 58 percent feel the party needs new leadership, with 11 percent undecided. Polling data from all likely voters shows an even higher percentage of American voters who think the Democratic Party needs new leadership. According to the poll, 64 percent think the current Democratic leadership is not representative of their voter base. The survey of 1,000 likely voters was conducted on June 22 and 25, 2017 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points.
