During a recent match, a New York college lacrosse team decided to do something a little more unconventional when taking the field before kickoff. However, as soon as Trump-hating liberals saw what they brought to the game, they immediately demanded the ‚Äoeoffensive‚Äù display earn the team punishment for hurting their feelings. As they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve proven on college campuses across the U.S., liberals are openly and vehemently opposed to free speech. Closing their minds to any differing views, even the mention of President Donald Trump can send millennials sprinting to the nearest safe space and demanding retribution solely because their hypersensitive institutions are offended. Fortunately, there are still freedom-loving scholars who couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care less if their patriotism causes discomfort to these entitled fascists. On May 10, Long Island‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Adelphi University men‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lacrosse team went viral after footage surfaced of their entrance routine on social media. The team proudly ran out on the field waving an American flag and warming up to Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚ÄoeMake America Great Again‚Äù speech set to patriotic music, according to CBS New York. ‚ÄoeIn all of our cities and all of our towns, I make this promise: We will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again,‚Äù Trump says in the recording. ‚ÄoeGod bless you, and good night. I love you.‚Äù Adelphi Lax bros come out the tunnel to a Trump speech. Somewhere is ready to run through a wall ‚Ä" Barstool Sports () May 10, 2017 As expected, the simple display triggered liberal students, who believe that only they have the right to express political views on campus. Unfortunately for them, they quickly learned that the same anti-First Amendment tactics used at other colleges weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t going to work at Adelphi. Adelphi athletic director Danny McCabe told Newsday that the music was not only selected by the team as a whole but that it follows the school‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s guidelines and will be allowed at future events. ‚ÄoeThe men‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lacrosse team‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s regular-season pregame warm-up music is selected as a team and approved for use so long as they do not contain vulgarity or inappropriate subject matter,‚Äù Adelphi athletic director Danny McCabe said in a statement. ‚ÄoeThe songs they proposed and used this season meet those guidelines. As such, we are obliged to follow the policy.‚Äù Men‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lacrosse coach Gordon Purdie added in a statement that the team ‚Äoetraditionally has chosen patriotic music‚Äù to accompany their entrance to the field. Of course, these leftists have no problem with their own running amok on campus, attempting to prevent anyone with whom they disagree from speaking. Ironically, they call themselves anti-fascists while pummeling their opposition and demanding the First Amendment have limitations that suit only them. The anti-Trump, anti-America atmosphere liberals have created in colleges is so thick they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not even trying to hide it anymore. During Cinco de Mayo, a Spanish teacher from Colorado‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Roosevelt High School encouraged students to beat a pi√±ata depicting President Trump. On the same day, liberal parents and students at Mills E. Godwin High School in Virginia demanded classmates be punished for flying the American flag on their vehicles. In March, students at American University signed a petition to terminate a professor for voting for Trump because they refused to allow anyone on campus who thinks differently than them. Also in March, liberal students at the University of Michigan demanded an apology from Professor Dan Demetriou for supporting Trump and opposing illegal immigration. It has become a social crime to think differently, thanks to the liberal mindset sweeping the nation. The left has stooped to ridiculous new lows by assaulting Americans for flying their own flag or agreeing with their own president. The madness is inherent in their efforts to eliminate free speech just to silence their critics. Liberals understand that ideas are powerful weapons, especially when based on logic. They know that if students are taught to question what they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re told, the leftist values and policies they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re pushing don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stand a chance. The left relies on compliant, emotion-driven militants who let the media think for them.
