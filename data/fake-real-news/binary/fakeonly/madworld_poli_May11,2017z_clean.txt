President Donald Trump is getting a good laugh over the new pictures he is hanging all over the West Wing. Trump commissioned the picture to be framed and ordered about a half dozen of them to be placed in the spaces inhabited by the liberal media. Well, they are freaking out, completely incensed by Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s choice of art, but you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to love it. Trey Yingst, chief White House Correspondent for One America News Network, reported on some new artwork going up in the West Wing. When sharing it to Twitter, Yingst had no idea the can of worms that he was opening up when he posted the picture Trump is framing ‚Ä" the now famous Electoral College map from the 2016 presidential election. Washington Post, Buzz Feed, Politico, and Voice of America, all liberal media outlets which Trump rightly calls ‚Äoefake news,‚Äù completely lost their minds. The social justice warriors came out firing off mean tweets, hoping this would cause Trump to change his mind. They should have known better because true to Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s usual fashion, he is doubling down, making sure that pic is all over the West Wing so those liberal nutjobs will have to look at it wherever they go. Wow, look at all that red! Spotted: A map to be hung somewhere in the West Wing ‚Ä" Trey Yingst () May 11, 2017 Below are some of the responses from the left-leaning mainstream media. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll notice the lack of liberal tolerance. They are so triggered, it seems they need their safe spaces, right away. Washington Post: Seriously, this is going to be included every time I lecture about misleading maps in my class ‚Ä" Andrew Ba Tran () May 11, 2017 -> No legend-> No source cited-> No creator credited-> 0/10, crappy dataviz ‚Ä" Christopher Ingraham () May 11, 2017 Politico: Subtle! ‚Ä" Shane Goldmacher () May 11, 2017 Voice of America: gonna need more info on this plz ‚Ä" William Gallo () May 11, 2017 BuzzFeed: Oh, my god, again. 0 ‚Ä" Tom Namako () May 11, 2017 Thisissounbelievablysad. ‚Ä" Parker Molloy () May 11, 2017 This picture triggered so many liberal loons, and all of them were freaking out about the ‚Äoepopular vote.‚Äù There is one thing that they forget about the popular vote, besides that it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t win you the presidential election. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t campaign to win the popular vote, you campaign to win the Electoral College. Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign had about ten staffers whose only job was to strategize on how to win the Electoral College, yet she fell short. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t trying to win the popular vote; they campaigned in those swing states where Hillary did not, they had the winning strategy, and thank God, the popular vote doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t decide the president. America is a Republic, something these numbskulls can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem to grasp. The Founding Fathers could have made it a straight democracy, but they saw that was flawed, and it all has to do with winning the presidency on the popular vote. As John Adams said, ‚ÄoeRemember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There was never a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.‚Äù Real Clear Politics further explains, ‚ÄoeThe Electoral College, where each state‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s allocation of electoral votes is simply the total of its representation in the House and Senate ‚Ä¶ gave the smaller states some additional power in the important choice of the president.‚Äù If we had a straight democracy, there would be chaos. Candidates would have to win 50.1% of the country‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s votes or there would be no majority voting for them. Hillary only had 48%, so she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t win anything, except she dominated in two states, California (55 electoral votes) and New York (29 electoral votes). Bill Clinton never won the 50.1% required for a majority vote, but we never heard he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the ‚Äoereal president.‚Äù The liberal snowflakes prove once again they will twist anything to make sure they get their way. So arrogant, they think they know better than the Founding Fathers, or simply, they are just uneducated fools who think their feelings matter more than facts. The picture of the 2016 Electoral College map shows Donald J. Trump won all of those states, big and small, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the only map that counts on Election Day. Way to go, President Trump.
