First Lady Melania Trump is in her ‚Äoemomma bear‚Äù mode, something we have rarely seen since her husband won the presidency. Americans have come to know Melania as quiet and reserved, but when her family is attacked, she is ready to lash back, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly what she did to Kathy Griffin. Melania made it very clear to the sicko, Griffin, what she really thinks of her, and it only took eight words. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. After the now infamous picture of Kathy Griffin holding a bloody, beheaded Donald Trump went viral, all hell broke loose. The image spread with fury across the internet Tuesday, drawing strong condemnation from both sides of the political aisle, as well as thousands of calls for a boycott of Griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s current cross-country comedy tour. Although Griffin would later issue an apology, the damage was already done. In fact, one consequence of her grotesque act was what happened to eleven-year-old Barron Trump, who happened to see the disturbing image on TV as it flashed across the screen during a news program. Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 31, 2017 The president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s son reportedly became ‚Äoepanicked‚Äù over the photo because he did not know who Griffin was or the context in which the photo was taken. Melania Trump waited 24 hours to respond. The First Lady isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t one to seek the limelight, and she generally wants nothing to do with politics, but she is a mother, and like all good mothers, when your kid is hurt, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to step in. ‚ÄoeAs a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,‚Äù Melania Trump said in a statement Wednesday. ‚ÄoeWhen you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.‚Äù Griffin is a liberal, and liberalism is a mental illness. People think that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a statement made jokingly, but it really is true. Liberalism, which evolves into socialism and communism, is based on selling the useful idiots this dream of a utopia that can never exist. Spread the wealth around, anything goes as far as morals are concerned, there is no God, and everyone has a right to an education, healthcare, food, and shelter and anyone who disagrees will be made an example of. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s evil ‚Ä" it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all a lie. ‚ÄoeThe image also reportedly led the U.S. Secret Service to open an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. Griffin apologized in a video posted to her Twitter account Tuesday, saying the image had gone ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>too far,'‚Äù reports Breitbart. When you see something like what Griffin did there is one silver-lining. It means they are losing, big time. They are deranged, going crazy over Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s successes. I am sorry. I went too far. I was wrong. ‚Ä" Kathy Griffin () May 30, 2017 Melania Trump reacted with grace and strength. She questions the mental health of Griffin as patriots question, daily, the mental health of most of the crazed Hollywood celebs, who are as sick as Kathy Griffin and the photographer who took the picture. God bless poor Barron Trump. Luckily, we know he has the best of parents who will make sure he is ok. This isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the first sick thing done to Trump, and unfortunately, it won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be the last.
