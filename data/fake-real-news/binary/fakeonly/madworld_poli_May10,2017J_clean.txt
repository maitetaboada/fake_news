As tensions between the United States and North Korea continue to escalate, totalitarian dictator Kim Jong-un shows no sign of backing down from his threats of aggression, even though recent reports of fake weaponry and failed missile tests would suggest that he is all bark and no bite. So, he will surely be panicking once he hears what a military pilot just said about what the U.S. has in store for our North Korean adversary. The F-35 is the newest addition to America‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s aerial arsenal. The fighter jet, produced by Lockheed Martin, has the same performance as others in terms of speed, turning, and range, but where it really excels is in the area of stealth. Retired US Marine Corps Maj. Dan Flatley will never forget the crushing feeling of helplessness that he experienced the first time he faced a stealth jet while he was flying in an F/A-18. ‚ÄoeI remember indelibly the moment in which the AWAC [airborne early warning and control plane] called out to me that there was a Raptor [an F-22 stealth fighter] in front of me at very close range that made me uncomfortable,‚Äù recalled Flatley. ‚ÄoeI had no way of targeting him, no way of defending myself.‚Äù That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s because other pilots cannot see the stealth fighter, but it can see them, causing intense fear and paranoia that even operators who have had years of training, in order to stay calm under pressure, cannot avoid. Years after Flatley‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s terrifying experience with the F-22, he would come to fly the F-35 and even help develop the curriculum for teaching other pilots to fly it. While the F-35 performs similarly to legacy jets in some areas like speed, turning, and range, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a huge, ever-growing information gap between what the F-35 pilot sees and what an F-18 pilot sees. The F-35 features six cameras stationed around the jet and a helmet display that allows pilots to literally look through the jet as if it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t there. It features the only infrared radar on a US fighter since the F-14, and uses unprecedented sensor-fusion capabilities to paint an incredibly vivid picture of its surroundings for miles out.

They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re at such a technological disadvantage,‚Äù said Flatley. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve seen guys in F-18s turn directly in front of me and show me their tails cause they have no idea I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m there.‚Äù ‚ÄoeIt aggregates to a completely inept response to what we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re doing in the air,‚Äù Flatley added. ‚ÄoePeople are so hellbent on shooting down the stealth fighter that they invariably make mistakes that I can exploit.‚Äù There is simply no way that North Korea, incapable of even manufacturing an adequate amount of traditional ammunition domestically, would stand a chance against the superior military technology possessed by the United States. Kim Jong-un ought to stick to what he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s good at ‚Ä" disseminating propaganda and stuffing his face. He couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take on the F-35 if he tried, which he may soon found out.
