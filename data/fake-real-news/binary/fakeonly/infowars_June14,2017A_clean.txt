Everyone who isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t an ignorant dunce knows leftists are anything but peaceful. Case in point? An Antifa broad, and Stranger Things girl lookalike, stabbed a police horse with a nail-studded flagpole. Before the rage makes your blood boil and smoke billows out of your ears, chill. The noble steed is a-okay. His attacker earned herself an all-expenses-paid trip to the slammer‚Ä¶ Just goes to show horseplay will not be tolerated‚Ä¶ Antifa, and leftists as a whole, try justifying these acts of hatred by claiming their victims are Nazis. I suppose they think they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll come across as less dickish if they dismiss their opponents as fascist, genocidal maniacs. Good luck trying to convince the world that the horse keeps a copy of Mein Kampf in his stable. Our offices called the PETA offices for comment on this ‚Äoeanti-fascist‚Äù fascist she-devil who tried to harm a horse. PETA put us on hold. Perhaps they were too busy making fake cat videos. Before you play devil‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s advocate and assume this is just one rotten apple in the cart, think again. The mainstream left has long advocated for violence like this. They know they can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t win on facts. Violence becomes their only option. As this story demonstrates, the only place violence will land you is in the big house. Where you can get a taste of what Communism is really like.
