Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell has just been caught aiding traitors of the United States, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shocking patriots across the country, who say ‚Äoeenough is enough.‚Äù Rosie probably thought she wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get caught, but then again, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not right in the head. As you check out what she did and how this means possible prison time for the Trump-hater, her sick actions will piss you off. Reality Winner, the 25-year-old contractor accused of illegally leaking U.S. secrets, was arrested Tuesday for giving classified documents, on a Russian cyber attack, to the left-wing outlet Intercept. She was caught almost immediately after Intercept showed copies of the document to the authorities, inadvertently giving away details that fingered Winner. In a surprising twist, Washington Free Beacon is reporting that ‚ÄoeTelevision personality Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell donated $1,000 to a GoFundMe campaign set up for Reality Winner. A GoFundMe was set up for those who wanted to support Winner. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>This is a time to come together and unite in peace and hope and show the world LOVE ALWAYS WINS over hate! Good resists even when evil persists!‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> the description reads. The largest contribution to the campaign came from a user named ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell.'‚Äù O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell confirmed the contribution came from her in a series of tweets, calling Winner a ‚Äoebrave young patriot.‚Äù Now, people across the country are pissed off because those who aid traitors are just as guilty as the traitors. Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the legal definition: ‚ÄoeA criminal charge of aiding and abetting or accessory can usually be brought against anyone who helps in the commission of a crime, though legal distinctions vary by state. A person charged with aiding and abetting or accessory is usually not present when the crime itself is committed, but he or she has knowledge of the crime before or after the fact, and may assist in its commission through advice, actions, or financial support.‚Äoe support reality winner speak truth to power #resist #womenUNITE ‚Ä" ROSIE () June 8, 2017 Makes just you a criminal like her. ‚Ä" Paul H Jensen () June 8, 2017 So you support traitors and treason. The same things you are "Fighting against?" ‚Ä" James Comey () June 8, 2017 Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell has been feuding with Donald Trump for more than a decade. She called him a ‚Äoesnake-oil salesman‚Äù on ‚ÄoeThe View,‚Äù and over the years, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s called her a loser, crude, fat, and dumb. Confronted with his ‚Äoebelittling‚Äù comments about women during a presidential debate, Trump interrupted, ‚ÄoeOnly Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell.‚Äù Winner is the first person to be prosecuted for leaking under a president who has been vowing a crackdown on leaks for months. On her social media feeds, Winner didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hide her disdain for President Trump, calling him an ‚Äoeorange fascist‚Äù and ‚ÄoeTangerine in Chief.‚Äù She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a real piece of work, and it would be great if Ms. Winner and Rosie could get matching jumpsuits and share a cell. Via Twitter, O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell confirmed to Atlanta Journal-Constitution late Wednesday that she made the $1,000 donation and said she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s willing to do more. ‚ÄoeI would love to help her and her family,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄoeI would love to talk to the mother and offer any help.‚Äù The GoFundMe account has raised more than $14,000 dollars. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to shut down that GoFundMe, what a travesty. With everything that is going on in this country, the last thing we need is for traitors to be profiting by committing treasonous acts. Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell is proving that she is truly an ignorant shrew, and I say she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s done enough damage to the country. Let her spend time in prison, where she belongs.
