Michelle Obama recently slammed President Donald Trump for canceling her pet project, the school lunch program, saying,‚ÄùWhy would anyone want our kids to eat crap?‚Äù The truth is that Michelle has a sick secret that hurt Malia and Sasha. Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s obsessions with her healthy food program for American schools was just a way to cover up her own demons that affected her daughters. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. The mainstream media is gushing over the recent selfies Michelle shared of a boot camp workout. Using Michelle as the epitome of perfection when it comes to healthy living, the media slammed Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s administration for ‚Äoefat-shaming‚Äù Sean Spicer. Apparently, Steve Bannon sarcastically told a reporter that they were cutting down on press conferences because ‚ÄoeSean got fatter.‚Äù But, what the mainstream media refuses to expose is that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Michelle Obama who fat-shamed her own kids. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right, Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s unhealthy obsession with weight led her to hurt her own kids. In 2009, Michelle said, ‚ÄoeWe went to our pediatrician all the time. I thought my kids were perfect but he [the doctor] warned that he was concerned that something was getting off balance.‚Äù She went on, ‚ÄoeMy kids could be in danger of becoming obese. We always think that only happens to someone else‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s kid ‚Ä" and I was in that position.‚Äù That led to Michelle putting her kids on a strict diet, but experts weighed in and saw right through her words. ‚ÄoeWhen we speak publicly about putting our children on a diet, we start to get into weight stigma and confusing the message to families,‚Äù said Laura Collins Lyster-Mensh, an eating disorder expert, and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not alone in her sentiments. In an op-ed, Dr. Abigail C. Saguy also told Michelle, ‚ÄoeMemo To Michelle, Fat-Shaming Is Not Ok!‚Äù Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own unhealthy obsession with weight, something she had struggled with her whole life would now become her daughters‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> problem as well. It wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t only Michelle who was obsessed with her kids‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> weight, Barack Obama was caught saying, ‚ÄoeA couple of years ago ‚Ä" you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d never know it by looking at her now ‚Ä" Malia was getting a little chubby.‚Äù He said that back in 2010 when Malia was just a little girl. Professor Paul Campos authored a piece for CBS News called ‚ÄoeHey Michelle, Stop Picking On Fat Kids.‚Äù He described Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>strict regime for her very young daughters, saying, ‚ÄoeMichelle banned the little girls from watching television on weekdays, put them on low-fat milk, replaced sugary drinks with water, largely eliminated hamburgers from their diet, and monitored portion sizes at meals carefully.‚Äù Yeah, basically, you can see Michelle as the food Nazi, which must have been a real nightmare for her kids. So, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s funny that the mainstream media is calling Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s administration ‚Äoebullies‚Äù as they forget about Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sick obsession as Vanity Fair reports, ‚ÄoeBut Michelle does it right. She manages to stay pitch-perfect and on-message. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s neither judgmental nor disingenuously concerned, neither moralizing nor self-flagellating in the way some fitness-heads are. There she is modeling healthy habits without judgment, while this [Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s] administration regresses to every bully‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s easiest material.‚Äù Michelle can post as many boot camp photos as she wants, but there is nothing normal about her sick food obsession that had American kids eating slop at lunch time. The Obama daughters were just little girls when Michelle put them on a strict regime, and then, she tried to put all Americans on that same diet. As for what Steve Bannon said about Sean Spicier, it was a sarcastic joke between two adults. Luckily, Michelle Obama, who wants to ban our sugary drinks and tell us what to eat, is no longer in power. Americans never asked her opinion on our food intake. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why she and Barack are gone, and Trump won. Jobs, taxes, and our military are what we want our president to fix, not intruding into our God-given right to raise our own children as we see fit.
