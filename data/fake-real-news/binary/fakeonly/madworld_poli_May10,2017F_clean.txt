The firing of James Comey comes as a relief to most patriotic Americans who lost trust in his leadership over his handling of the Hillary Clinton investigation, but most people don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know all the events that led up to President Donald Trump actually firing him. It involves a young congresswoman, who uncovered Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s explosive secrets, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all Trump needed to get rid of the disgraced FBI Director. This will blow your mind. The beginning of the end for James Comey started on March 20, 2017, when he was answering questions under oath before the congressional committee investigating the so-called Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. Rep. Elise M. Stefanik (R-NY) is the youngest member of congress at 32 years old, and on March 20, she singlehandedly finished Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s career. Not many people were paying attention to a junior congresswoman questioning the FBI Director, but what she uncovered is pure gold. Remember, at this time, Trump had accused Obama of wiretapping him and the Democrats were accusing Trump of colluding with Russia. During questioning, Rep. Stefanik lured Comey into a trap. She got Comey to admit that a counter-intel investigation into the Russia-Trump connection started way back in July 2016. Think about that; this is so fishy because Trump had just been nominated by the GOP, and immediately, the Obama White House starts a bogus investigation trying to link Russia to Trump. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s called a political witch hunt. But, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not all. The damning admission leads to questions about wiretapping private citizens like Trump and his staff. Then, Comey tripped up and couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t recover. Rep. Stefanik knew Comey was required to alert congress about this investigation into Russia and Trump, but he couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do that, could he? If Comey followed the rules set out by the Department of Justice, he had to inform congress, but if he did, the GOP would have blown up and exposed this as an obvious political witch hunt to destroy their presidential candidate. ‚ÄoeOn March 20th the mask fully came off. Comey was a solid Black Hat. The March 20th appearance before congress was the final straw in showcasing just how politically corrupt James Comey was,‚Äù The Conservative Treehouse reports. Rep. Stefanik cornered Comey on the timeline and got him to stumble and squirm. She asked, ‚ÄoeWhen did you notify the White House, the DNI, and congressional leadership [of the bogus investigation]?‚Äù Comey immediately started sweating after admitting that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s protocol to inform congress quarterly and the investigation started in July 2016. Then, came the kicker. Comey didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t inform congress until March 2017, only after he had no other choice as these hearings were set to begin. Watch as Rep. Stefanik outsmarted Comey and lured him into admitting he was in essence spying on GOP candidate Trump for former President Barack Obama. One other point of note, James Comey outright lies by claiming there was no active DNI (Department of National Intelligence), which is entirely false since James Clapper was Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s DNI. The Conservative Treehouse weighed in, explaining, ‚ÄoeFormer FBI Director James Comey intentionally kept congress in the dark on his investigative activity. Our system of checks and balances are specifically set up to stop this from happening, and to keep a watch on the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>watchers.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Director Comey subverted the oversight for his own political purposes.‚Äù There is no defense for the former FBI director acting alone and not notifying congress of what he is doing through the established protocols. It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter who the FBI director is. Comey should have been fired on March 20th after he told congress he was intentionally not allowing them oversight over his conduct. So, when the liberal loons accuse President Donald Trump of firing James Comey to stop an investigation into Russia, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a pile of crap. They have investigated it ad infinitum, and they can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t prove a damn thing because it is something the Obama White House and former Director Comey invented way back in July 2016. They hoped to uncover a scandal on Trump to help Hillary win the election and they came up short. Now, Comey has had to answer for his sins. The Democrats continue to implode, still whining about the election, while President Trump sits back and laughs. He got them again as one more swamp creature is removed from Washington, D.C.
