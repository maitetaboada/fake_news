Maxine Waters‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> crazy obsession with President Donald Trump has gone from nutty talking points to physical altercations with the public. The California congresswoman is resorting to violence, and this time, eyewitnesses and those viewing the video are describing her as going ‚Äoebatsh*t crazy‚Äù after a reporter said three words. Everything about the incident exposes what her staffers want to hide; Maxine‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s got a mental disorder and needs to resign. Maxine Waters has been in two altercations within the last few days, and this one proves that she is so completely unhinged that she now has a diagnosable mental disorder. Before we get to that, let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s review what just happened between Maxine and Micheal Tracey, a reporter from The Young Turks. Many of you may already know that The Young Turks are a leftist media outlet. So, with that in mind, consider how incredibly paranoid Maxine has become of anyone that approaches her for comments. The Gateway Pundit reports, ‚ÄoeReporter Michael Tracey and his cameraman approached Maxine Waters in order to ask a few questions and she went off on an unhinged rant. Nothing shocking here, what is shocking, however, was her shoving the reporter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s microphone for no reason.‚Äù Crazy Maxine assumes the reporter is with Fox News as she confirmed in a tweet right after the incident. The following is a transcript of the back-and-forth between Tracey and Waters toward the end of the interview when she loses it over three words, ‚Äoewas Obama mistaken.‚Äù Tracey: ‚ÄoeYou say Russia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not our friend, was Obama mistaken to forge military cooperation with Russia in Syria and try to . . .‚Äù Waters: ‚ÄoeLook, you and I have a different agenda, young man. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m out to impeach this President ‚Ä" get that straight. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m out to impeach the President. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not gonna be diverted by people who are Obama haters. Here's the full interview. Sensitive viewers, you are warned. dD ‚Ä" Tommy Christopher () June 3, 2017 Reporter Michael Tracey is not an ‚ÄoeObama-hater.‚Äù He works for Cenk Uygur, a huge liberal who hates Donald Trump, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s how paranoid Maxine is. The truth is, liberals know crazy Maxine is a liability, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why conservatives want her as the face of the Democratic Party. Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the tweet where she possibly thinks The Young Turks reporter is from Fox News. Trump can unleash the full force of Fox, fringe, & fake news media on me all he wants. I'm not going anywhere! #getreadyforimpeachment ‚Ä" Maxine Waters () June 3, 2017 What‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s incredibly funny is Auntie Maxine‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s line, ‚ÄoeI can eat gum and walk at the same time.‚Äù She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s referring to the reporter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s observation that all she cares about is this fantasy of impeaching Trump when she has a duty to her constituents. Well, while she is being diagnosed with delusions of grandeur and Trump Derangement Syndrome, Omar Navarro, the GOP challenger for California‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 43rd District, is getting a ton of support as this latest Maxine Waters debacle is making headlines. Navarro pinned this tweet he sent to Maxine Waters to the top of his Twitter account. Cleanse yourself because the only person who needs impeachment is you. Broken communities in Los Angeles. ‚Ä" Omar Navarro () March 21, 2017 Maxine has represented the 43rd District for 25 years, yet look at the state of the streets in the photos Navarro shows above. She also went nuts after a female constituent approached her a few days ago. ‚ÄoeEven after her constituent tells her that she supports the president, Maxine goes off on some crazy tangent about how he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a liar and that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to work nonstop to get him impeached. Her constituent responded that she would also work to make sure Maxine was impeached. She literally then said, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>You cannot impeach a woman of color,'‚Äù reports Twitchy. NEW: Constituent confronts Maxine Waters: ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to work every day to make sure that [Trump] isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t impeached and that you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re impeached.‚Äù ‚Ä" Josh Caplan () May 30, 2017 Maxine Waters has become a total embarrassment for the Democratic Party. She seems to be deteriorating into further delusions and madness every day. Her staffers are quite aware that she is on thin ice. They only allowed the liberal Young Turks reporter near her, but she still lost it. Like Hillary Clinton, they are trying to prop her up, and like Hillary Clinton, Maxine Waters‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> career will end in disgrace. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been scamming this country for years, and we look forward to the day she is driven from the halls of Congress for good.
