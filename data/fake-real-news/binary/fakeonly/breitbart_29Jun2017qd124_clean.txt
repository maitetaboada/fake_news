We then asked some wonderful artists to turn some of these messages into a series of posters,‚Äù explained London Pride. ‚ÄoeIt is clear we misjudged the content of some of the messages in this poster series, undermining the individuality, importance, and dignity of the LGBT+ community. This was never our intention, and we are genuinely sorry to have played any part in something that appears to devalue our own community, and have removed these four images from our campaign.‚Äù ‚ÄoeLondon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s LGBT+ community is vibrant, diverse and strong, with incredible activists at its heart. Our ambition is, and always will be to promote and celebrate the visibility and diversity of London‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s LGBT+ community, to stand up against hate, and campaign for true equality at home and abroad,‚Äù they continued. ‚ÄoeThis year has seen our largest ever LGBT+ campaign, taking our messages of love around the world, breaking new ground in the UK, launching new services to tackle hate crime and raising awareness of the persecution of LGBT+ people around the world.‚Äù Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
