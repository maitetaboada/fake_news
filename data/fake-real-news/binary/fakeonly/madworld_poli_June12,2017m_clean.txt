The Democratic Party seems to love terrorists. First, they allowed 69-year-old Rasmea Odeh, who was convicted of two bombings in Israel, to lead the Womenâ€<sup>TM</sup>s March on Washington. Then, over the weekend, another convicted terrorist was honored by the left during a parade in New York City. Perhaps even more shocking, though, is who was spotted right next to the terroristâ€<sup>TM</sup>s float. On Sunday, the Puerto Rican Day parade was held in New York, but not without controversy. The scandal began when news broke that terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera was to be honored atop a float. Lopez Rivera was the head of the FALN which planted 120 bombs throughout the country and killed people in NYC during the 1970s and 1980s. He has never renounced his actions and still holds the U.S. government to be an enemy. Despite this, former President Barack Obama commuted his sentence. [Source: Young Conservatives] Upon receiving word that Lopez Rivera was to be honored at the Puerto Rican Day parade, multiple sponsors pulled their support. The most notable of them was Goya, a company which had been part of the parade since its launch in 1958. Some politicians who had originally said that they would be marching also pulled out of the event, leading Lopez Rivera to announce that he would be turning down the honor bestowed upon him by the left in order to avoid further controversy. However, just as tensions began to ease, Democratic City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito started fighting tooth and nail to keep Lopez Rivera in the parade, even holding parties in his honor as the event approached. When it kicked off on Sunday, the terrorist was riding on the first float, joined by Mark-Viverito. Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio, who originally said he would not march if Lopez Rivera was present, also took part in the parade, although he kept about ten blocks away from the terrorist just for good measure. This may have been a safe distance in the event that Lopez Rivera decided to set off any last-minute bombs, but certainly not to save face for de Blasio, whose true motives became painfully clear. The Democrats sure know how to pick â€<sup>TM</sup>em. If theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re not honoring a terrorist, theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re letting one out of prison or allowing one to organize an event. Meanwhile, they seemingly have no time whatsoever for actual heroes, like the brave men and women of our armed forced. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s pathetic, really.
