Sources close to the elitist Bilderberg Group conference tell Infowars that globalists see their agenda as being in ‚Äoedeep trouble‚Äù and that Donald Trump poses a ‚Äoedangerous‚Äù risk to the international order and must be brought to heel or turfed out of office. Over the years, Infowars has developed sources close to the conference who feed us information ahead of time as to the real agenda behind the confab, not just the vague list of topics released officially by Bilderberg. Given that this is the first year since both Brexit and Trump came to pass, the effort to derail both is very much the primary focus of discussion amongst globalists in attendance this week. The reason that three members of the Trump administration ‚Ä" HR McMaster, Wilbur Ross and Chris Liddell have been invited to attend this year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s meeting in Chantilly, Virginia is that Bilderberg thinks there is still a chance to put pressure on Trump to force him to back down on his America-first agenda. With the U.S. about to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, Trump is ‚Äoedangerously obsessed‚Äù with derailing the current world order, according to one Bilderberger, a fear that has intensified since Trump chided world leaders at the G7 summit last week. Globalists are baffled as to Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoeerratic‚Äù style of governance and are panicked that he could undo decades of work they put in to build the new world order. However, Bilderbergers still think Trump can be brought to his senses and taught ‚Äoehow the world really works,‚Äù a line that is typical of the arrogance that has come to epitomize the attitude of Bilderberg members over the years. Given the highly unlikely scenario of Trump taking orders from Bilderberg, the only recourse left for the elite will be to turf him out of office. Another Bilderberger is confident that Trump can be impeached, but only if Democrats regain control of Congress in 2018, in which case his days are ‚Äoenumbered‚Äù. If the impeachment of Trump is in process by the end of 2018, globalists are confident that any effort on behalf of his administration to pull out of the Paris climate agreement and any other globalist treaties will be thwarted. On the subject of Brexit, globalists still think that the UK‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exit from the European Union can be prevented. Elitists plan to make the withdrawal process as messy and as drawn out as possibly, taking as long as five years, before which point they hope to force through a vote in Parliament that will reverse the results of the referendum.
