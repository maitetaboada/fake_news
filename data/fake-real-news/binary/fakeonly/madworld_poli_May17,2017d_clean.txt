Twenty-seven-year-old Democratic staffer Seth Conrad Rich was murdered in Washington, D.C. on July 8, 2016. Although his death was portrayed as a robbery, the killers left behind his wallet, watch, and cell phone, leading to serious doubts about their motive. Now, just two months ahead of the anniversary of his death, a chilling new video has emerged of Rich that will surely turn your stomach. Even Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own father expressed his suspicions that his son‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s death wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the result of a violent robbery, saying, ‚ÄoeIf it was a robbery ‚Ä" it failed because he still has his watch, he still has his money ‚Ä" he still has his credit cards, still had his phone so it was a wasted effort except we lost a life.‚Äù Meanwhile, internet sleuths claimed to have uncovered Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s last movements on that fateful morning, saying he had been en route to the FBI to speak to special agents about an ‚Äoeongoing court case‚Äù potentially involving the Clinton family. As leads dwindled in the case, the Metropolitan Police offered a reward for information pertaining to Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s murder. Then, in August, WikiLeaks upped the ante by offering their own $20,000 reward for information on the suspicious murder. Founder and CEO of WikiLeaks Julian Assange also suggested quite firmly that Rich had been an informant for his organization, but this wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t confirmed until this week, when it was revealed that Rich had, indeed, sent WikiLeaks 44,000 emails. A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report ‚Ä" generated within 96 hours after DNC staffer Seth Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s murder ‚Ä" detailing the contents Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s computer said he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time. [Source: Fox News] ‚ÄoeMy investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,‚Äù said Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor. ‚ÄoeI do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters.‚Äù It certainly is looking more and more like the Clinton camp had Rich silenced, as they have been known to do to their adversaries. However, not only did Hillary Clinton allegedly have Rich murdered, but she then used his death to push for further gun control on the campaign trail, according to The Gateway Pundit. Never let a good tragedy go to waste, right? The video of Hillary Clinton using Seth Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s death for political gain is enough to turn your stomach. This was a 27-year-old young man with his entire life ahead of him, yet to Hillary, he was nothing more than a political prop. She is pure evil. Thank God, she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t win the election. We don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t need gun control. We need Clinton control.
