The temperature of liberal politicians in Washington, D.C., has hit an all-time high as retired General and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn just dropped a huge bomb on their sham Trump-Russian collusion probe. Now, they are going to have to come up with a new strategy to sabotage President Donald Trump after what Flynn just did. According to Daily Caller, Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn dropped a huge bomb on the liberal‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s witchhunt by informing the Senate Intelligence Committee that he will not honor their subpoena to turn over any documents detailing his interactions with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign. Now, many of them want Flynn to be held in contempt of Congress, which could mean further trouble for the retired general. If the Senate bigwigs decide that Flynn is in contempt due to his refusal to comply, the matter would be referred over to the Department of Justice where Attorney General Jeff Sessions would have to determine whether to file charges. It is also possible that a federal district court would civilly enforce the order, which I think is quite possible considering the number of activist liberal judges who currently infest our judicial branch of government. According to the Huffington Post, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said to reporters Thursday that Flynn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lawyers have not turned over any of the requested documents and added that there ‚Äoemay be a day or two left‚Äù for them to comply. ‚ÄoeMichael Flynn has not cooperated with the committee up to this point,‚Äù Burr said, adding that he has not received a ‚Äoedefinitive answer‚Äù on whether Flynn and his legal counsel are going to honor the subpoena. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s obvious that Burr may be trying to give Flynn a few more days to comply so that he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to take the hard road through the DoJ. Even if the Senate Intel Committee decided to ask Sessions to prosecute Flynn, it could take years for that legal process to pan out. Flynn left his post in February, after revealing that he did not inform Vice President Mike Pence of his contact with certain Russian officials before Trump took office. Burr would not say if he plans to recommend a contempt of Congress vote regarding Flynn. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not going to go into what we might or might not do. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got a full basket of things we might want to test,‚Äù he said. What should be the focus of the Senate Intel Committee is Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s political surveillance of Donald Trump before and after the election. When will American‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s get justice for the crimes committed against our democracy by the former administration? When will his henchmen and henchwomen go to jail for illegally unmasking the names of numerous American citizens? I think these are much more important questions for the Senate to answer. As President Trump continues to play this ultimate game of political chess, American patriots will keep praying for him and supporting our nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s return to its former greatness.
