Hi! I am rich! I have five Kinder Eggs that I brought from the store. Do you want to know how to get enough money to buy fiveKinder Eggs? This is the most Kinder Eggs I have ever seen! I have a lot of money in my piggy bank, but I didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t even need to touch it to buy these five Kinder Eggs! TIP 1 I was at the grocery store, and I asked my grandma if I could have a treat and buy it with money, and then my grandma said yes, and then she looked in her wallet and she only had the green moneys, and it said twenty on the side, and that was the only kind she had so she had to give me one of the green moneys, and then I took five Kinder Eggs and gave them to the lady at the conveyor belt, and gave her the green money, and then she gave me the Kinder Eggs back. I HAVE FIVE KINDER EGGS! TIP 2 Grandma was looking around, like this and she said, â€<sup>~</sup>your motherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s going to kill meâ€<sup>TM</sup>, and she looked kind of sad but she knew that if she took away my Kinder Eggs I was going to cry, so I got to keep ALL FIVE KINDER EGGS TIP 3 I love Kinder Eggs. Because they have toys and chocolate! And I love chocolate and toys. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m going to open the one with the loudest noise. Shake shake shake! This one.

TIP 5 Medium-maturity funds are an excellent foundation to build your bond portfolio. A prime example is Fidelity Total Bond, which holds a wide variety of debt from corporations as well as some foreign bonds, which should help if the dollar rises any further. Highly Recommended.
