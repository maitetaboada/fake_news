National Security Administration staffer Reality ‚ÄoeSara‚Äù Winner was taken into custody by the FBI, charged with leaking top secret documents to a left-wing media outlet, and she is facing 20-30 years in prison. Winner‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s statements prove she is clearly a hardcore leftist nutjob who hates President Donald Trump, but there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s one big problem the mainstream media doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want you to know. If you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re like most Americans, you are satisfied that after so many leaks, finally, we have someone arrested. However, once you get deeper into who twenty-five-year-old Reality Winner is and what she leaked, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll see this is looking like a set-up. In fact, shocking evidence confirms that this is all a set-up by Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enemies to overthrow him. ‚ÄoeReality Leigh ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Sara‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Winner is a Georgia resident and an employee of NSA contractor Pluribus International Corp. She has held a top secret security clearance since at least February. She made her first federal court appearance in Augusta, Georgia, Monday afternoon,‚Äù reports The Conservative Treehouse. What we know for sure is that Reality Leigh Winner, who also goes by ‚ÄoeReality Winner,‚Äù ‚ÄoeSara Winner,‚Äù and ‚ÄoeSara Winners,‚Äù is a 25-year-old NSA staffer who had top secret security clearance. We know from her social media accounts that she is a liberal loon who hates Trump with a vengeance, supports Iran, and is a rabid global warming nutjob. Gateway Pundit reports, ‚ÄoeFrom her Facebook page Reality likes Animal Rights, The Daily Show, Bill Maher, Michael Moore, and the Trump bashing ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Trump Draws‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Facebook page.‚Äù She has tweets calling Trump a c*nt and asking Kanye West to make a shirt saying, ‚Äoebeing white is terrorism.‚Äù you should make a shirt that says, "being white is terrorism" ‚Ä" Sara Winners () February 26, 2017 #TrumpIsACunthttps:// ‚Ä" Sara Winners () January 30, 2017 Winner is charged with leaking a classified NSA report on Russian election interference, published by the liberal online publication The Intercept. This is where it starts getting very strange. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s caught leaking so-called evidence, an NSA summary judgment that Russia not only hacked to influence our election, but they left all kinds of ‚Äoefingerprints‚Äù all over that leads right back to their ‚ÄoeGRU,‚Äù which is the equivalent of our CIA. The ‚Äoesummary‚Äù even implies that they were trying to hack into our voting machines, which is impossible. ‚ÄoeThe NSA document alleges the GRU hacked the voting systems company using a false Google alert requiring a target to enter login credentials. According to the report, it also attempted a parallel campaign using a false email account meant to be confused with a second company. And yet, despite all that ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>sophistication,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Russia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s smartest, government hackers somehow left a trail so obvious that it would allow the NSA to conclude in under a month, that Russia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s GRU was behind it,‚Äù reports Zero Hedge. The classified documents also allegedly state that Russia hacked us ‚Äoeto undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary [Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.‚Äù Wow, that sounds like something the Democrats would have written since it fits their narrative to a T. Remember, all of this is alleged, and we only have the word of the leftist media outlet Intercept to go by; no one else has seen these classified documents. Now, does this sound like a set-up? First, you have this idiot 25-year-old Reality Winner, who is most probably highly manipulated, and secondly, she turns over what the NSA is claiming to be a report that fits perfectly with the Democrats allegations about Russia hacking our election, and lastly, it undermines the presidency of Donald Trump. That all worked out a little too easy for Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enemies, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you think? This whole Reality Winner story doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t pass the smell test. This is not the kind of leaker President Trump was looking for; he is looking for the Obama holdovers who are leaking legitimate classified information. He is also looking for leakers inside the White House. This low-level nobody ‚ÄoeReality Winner‚Äù is arrested by Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s people at the FBI only 48 hours before he is to testify? That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really convenient for Comey and Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enemies. Reality Winner is not one of the big players or spies Trump is looking for, but she is working for those scumbags, although she is not ‚Äoein the loop.‚Äù The end game is to set-up Trump, and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sure they told her that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d never be caught. Those big named traitors have one huge problem when the truth comes out. It always does, and you can bet President Trump will show them no mercy.
