Michelle Obama was acting very sneaky as she was caught boarding a private jet to Los Angeles. Her mission is the same as it was when she jetted to Italy last month to trash the Trumps, but this time, Melania was ready for Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sick game. While sneaky Michelle started trash talking the Trumps in front of corporate big wigs, Melania outsmarted, outshined, and outclassed her nemesis in one brilliant move. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to love this. Michelle Obama snuck away to Los Angeles to be a ‚Äoesurprise‚Äù guest at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, and she insisted on a media blackout of her comments at the event. Right away, you have to ask yourself, what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Michelle Obama going to say that she doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want the public to know? Parts of her talk we may never know, but she sure let her remarks about the Trumps leak to the press. Michelle Obama is following in Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s footsteps, getting paid millions to speak in front of big corporations, the very people she and Barack say they loathe. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the part we aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t allowed to know about. What she did leak to the press were her remarks trashing Trump as she said, ‚ÄoeI think my message earlier was, you know, think about that higher purpose. Because we are at a time in this country when we need problem solvers out there who are committed, who believe in this country, who believe in the value of diversity and believe in, you know, the value of immigrants, and believe that global warming is real.‚Äù Easier for Michelle to rant about, instead of taking out & cleaning up her/Obama's own trash. How un-American "trashing" the USA? Pure hate. ‚Ä" Cindy Smith () June 7, 2017 If you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re like other patriots across the country, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re sick and tired of the Obamas and their pontificating as if they are still in office. But, never fear, Melania was on top of Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shenanigans. While Michelle was hobnobbing with big corporate billionaires, the First Lady had a press release written up, letting the country know what she would be doing on that same night, June 5th. ‚ÄoeThis evening at the White House, President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, hosted a reception to honor Gold Star families and those they have lost,‚Äù says the White House press release. ‚ÄoeGold Star families have lost an immediate family member who was serving during wartime, and they are a unique and distinct category of individuals who should be cherished,‚Äù First Lady Melania Trump said. .Potus & I paid personal tribute to #GoldStarFamilies tonight . Thank U to all the brave men&women who have fought 4 our freedom! ‚Ä" Melania Trump () June 6, 2017 The First Lady‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s statement continues, ‚ÄoeThese families have endured the ultimate in pain and sacrifice on behalf of our country, and I am honored to have spent the evening with them. My husband and I commit to always pay tribute to our active service military, veterans, and the families who love them.‚Äù While Michelle continues to divide the country with her leftist talking points on diversity and immigrants, which means Muslim migrants and illegal aliens, her message is loud and clear. We all know she is talking about President Trump, and we say so what? That same message was a big fat loser with the country when Hillary Clinton had that same narrative as her platform. Michelle Obama is a bitter loser who refuses to just get out of the way of our new First Lady. Melania Trump decided to make a statement through that press release, which was written up as Michelle Obama was delivering her comments in Los Angeles. In one brilliant move, Melania reminded the country and the Obamas what matters most to Americans. The Gold Star dinner was planned weeks ago for June 5th, but when Michelle popped up again trying to steal the limelight, Melania said, ‚Äoeno more.‚Äù President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are true patriots. The Obamas can scurry like rats across the globe, trying to undermine the current administration, but their game is old, and the time has come for them to do what Americans voted for on November 8th. We voted for Trump, thoroughly rejecting Barack and Michelle Obama. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for them to get the hell out of the way; we are undoing all the damage Obama inflicted on the country and helping our president make America great again.
