Beaverton writers Cathryn Naiker and Dave Barclay are sports experts. Sort of. Well, theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re working on it. Join them as they discuss all the biggest stories, plus a lot of talk about the ridiculous side of being a fan. From hot takes on the NHL trade deadline to a serious look at which athlete makes the best wine, theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve got you covered. Dave quizzes Cathryn about the MLB draft, they debate who will win in the new Wintersport Superfinals- Penguins or Warriors and they both rate the CFLâ€<sup>TM</sup>s uniforms on a scale using 0, 1 roughrider or two Roughriders.
