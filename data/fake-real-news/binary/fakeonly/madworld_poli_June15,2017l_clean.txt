The father of Otto Warmbier held a press conference just hours after his son came home in very bad shape from North Korea. Otto was a political prisoner, held by the brutal regime of Kim Jong-un. Otto‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dad, Fred, was so grateful to President Trump, but when the press asked him about Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s role in getting his son home, he destroyed the former president with 5 words. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Fred Warmbier held a press conference to talk about his ordeal with getting his son home from those communist animals who were holding him as a political prisoner. Otto mysteriously slipped into a coma while in the custody of Kim Jong-un‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s brutal regime, and he was sentenced to ‚Äoehard labor‚Äù for 15 years. Knowing the harsh inhumane treatment that Jong-un gives his own people, Otto was probably worked to death, starved, and mentally abused. Fred Warmbier has no idea how long his son has been in a coma, but reports are that it may have been over 12 months. The likelihood of Otto ever regaining consciousness is very slim, and Fred spoke about his son in the past tense. It was an extremely emotional press conference, and Fred was adamant that he was there for Otto and that he is not political. #Warmbier: "The North Koreans lure Americans to travel to North Korea via tour groups that run out of China." ‚Ä" Fox News () June 15, 2017 ‚ÄoeThe North Koreans lure Americans‚Äù to the country through tour groups, claiming that the region is a safe place to travel, Warmbier says. He adds that they agreed to let Otto go because of the claims that it would have been an educational trip. ‚ÄoeHe was taken hostage at the airport as he was trying to leave the country,‚Äù said Warmbier. ‚ÄoeFred Warmbier also dismissed whatever efforts were made on behalf of his 22-year-old son Otto by the Obama administration, which asked the family to keep a low profile when news of Otto‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s arrest became public. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>The results speak for themselves,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> he said in a news conference, adding that President Trump, by contrast, reached out to him personally,‚Äù reports Fox News. The results sure do speak for themselves. Warmbier said the Obama administration told him and his family to ‚Äoestay quiet‚Äù and ‚Äoenot to make waves.‚Äù Obama told Otto‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family that Kim Jong-un and North Korea could get very upset and that the US couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t risk that. Warmbier said that tactic, of staying silent, didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do a damn thing so he finally decided to abandon any advice from Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s minions. Warmbier: "We were advised that, 'It was important that you don't upset the North Koreans.' We followed that logic‚Ä¶ [No] impact." 1 ‚Ä" Fox News () June 15, 2017 His son went into a coma on Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s watch, and it was only when Trump took office that hope returned. So, when Fred Warmbier says that Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoeresults speak for themselves,‚Äù he is talking about his son, with severe neurological damage, languishing in a coma in North Korea. ‚ÄoeLast evening, we received a very nice phone call from President Trump, who told us that Secretary of State Tillerson worked hard to bring Otto home. We are extremely grateful for their efforts and concern,‚Äù said Warmbier. He also said that Trump was so gracious and said, if there was anything else he could do, to just call him. I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t imagine the anger I would have if my son was Otto Warmbier. The Obama regime literally told them to shut up because we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to piss off Kim Jong-un. Aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t we the super power? Aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t we America, the most feared nation on earth? This is just another very sick example of Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presidency gone so wrong. Thank God, we do not have that man in power any longer, and thank God, we have a president who will put the full resources of the United States in play to rescue one American soul. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly how our country is made great again, and as President Trump said, ‚ÄoeOtto Warmbier is an American no longer forgotten, we have brought him home.‚Äù
