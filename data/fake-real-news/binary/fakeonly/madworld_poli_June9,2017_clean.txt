As we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve seen several times from the Clinton family, they always seem to imply that they know more than the American people. In fact, Chelsea Clinton decided to prove just that when she lectured adults about children in the USA most recently ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about the time she cold-cocked herself in the face with some brutal karma. The Clinton family is like herpes ‚Ä" it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s unsightly, extremely uncomfortable, and it just won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go away. Even worse yet, perhaps the most annoying member of the family has recently been thrust into the spotlight after her mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s catastrophic failure last November. As most of the country is aware, the left has been flaunting Chelsea Clinton around as if she was the ‚Äoechosen one‚Äù to fight for the rights of liberalism and women everywhere. Along with that, she has virtually no experience, and she is nowhere near as smart as the left seems to believe that she is. Come to find out, she recently proved just that, herself, when she decided to lecture the country on America‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s children. According to Twitchy, she decided to share some extensive research via Twitter that most people thought was really just some common sense: Research again confirms kids pay more attention in class & better retain what they're taught when they're not hungry ‚Ä" Chelsea Clinton () June 7, 2017 Written by The New York Times, the article that Chelsea thought the world needed to see explained that ‚Äoekids pay more attention in class and better retain what they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re taught when they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not hungry.‚Äù So, yeah ‚Ä" the hot tip of the day is basically the fact that kids need food to function. Who would have thought, right? Well, apparently, everyone. In fact, it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t long before people were writing in saying just that. However, what no one was really expecting was that there was a real reason that Chelsea saw fit to post it, and of course, politics were involved. Clearly demonstrating how very little she knows about politics despite growing up in the political world, Chelsea decided to blame Republicans for hungry kids. ‚ÄoeSadly, many Republicans continue to argue against free school lunches & breakfasts & against nutritional support for families,‚Äù she responded to one tweet. Agreed. Sadly, many Republicans continue to argue against free school lunches & breakfasts & against nutritional support for families ‚Ä" Chelsea Clinton () June 8, 2017 Too bad for her, she managed to cold-cock herself in the face with the humiliating remarks and even took an unintentional swipe at Michelle Obama as well. As we all know, the only politicians to ever outwardly and purposefully leave kids hungry was the former First Lady through her abysmal school lunch program. Then again, others decided to attack Chelsea on her apparent lack of knowledge on, well, just about everything. In short, Chelsea wants kids to have free lunches, but it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take a genius to know that nothing is really ever without cost ‚Ä" it just means that someone else is paying for it. When it comes down to it, the left is so desperate to make the right look bad that they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re willing to take the most pathetic person and put them in the spotlight. Too bad for them, that backfired big time. Sure, the left wants to make it look like the GOP starves kids and kicks puppies and stuff, but that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just not true, and it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter how hard you try to sell it, anyone with common sense can see through it. Of course, if you try too hard to push a false narrative, you could end up virtually punching yourself in the face while attacking your closest friends and looking like a clueless moron on the national stage, just ask Chelsea.
