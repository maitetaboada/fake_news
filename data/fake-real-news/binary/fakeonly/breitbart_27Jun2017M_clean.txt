Any further attacks done to the people of Syria will be blamed on Assad, but also on Russia & Iran who support him killing his own people. ‚Ä" Nikki Haley () June 27, 2017 ‚ÄoeThe United States has identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime that would likely result in the mass murder of civilians, including innocent children,‚Äù the White House statement said. ‚ÄoeThe activities are similar to preparations the regime made before its April 4, 2017 chemical weapons attack.‚Äù ‚ÄoeAs we have previously stated, the United States is in Syria to eliminate the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria,‚Äù the statement continued. ‚ÄoeIf, however, Mr. Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons, he and his military will pay a heavy price.‚Äù In April, Assad‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s troops were accused of launching a chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun that killed at least 80 people, including women and children. U.S. officials said after the attack that they had evidence that Assad had ordered it. The horrific attack prompted a U.S. missile strike on a military base. ‚ÄoeThe Kremlin described the warning as an unacceptable threat and said Russia had no information about a new chemical attack,‚Äù the Guardian reported. ‚ÄoeHowever, the Russian and Syrian militaries are closely intertwined.‚Äù ‚ÄoeThe White House warning came on the same day the chief of the Russian general staff, General Valery Gerasimov met with Assad at Khmeimim air base near Latakia,‚Äù the newspaper added.

In May, Haley became the highest ranking American official to be so near Syrian territory in years when she visited the ‚Äoeno-man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s land‚Äù between Syria and Turkey. ‚ÄoeFerried to the border in an armored motorcade, Haley walked to within just a few feet of entering the Arab land,‚Äù the Associated Press reported. ‚ÄoeUnderscoring the danger, security officials spirited her away from the border after unmarked vehicles were spotted moving toward the area.‚Äù ‚ÄoeBeyond the frontier, she confronted a human reminder of the world‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s failure to resolve the war: About 8,400 Syrian refugees in a Turkish refugee camp, some of them stuck there for more than five years,‚Äù AP reported. ‚ÄoeThe dominant theme of Haley‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s trip this week to Jordan and Turkey was the need to retool the global approach to meet the needs of Syrians stuck in a protracted conflict now in its seventh year,‚Äù AP reported. ‚ÄoeHaley said she wanted to ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>bring new life‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> to efforts to help the refugees, mentioning schooling and training in particular.‚Äù
