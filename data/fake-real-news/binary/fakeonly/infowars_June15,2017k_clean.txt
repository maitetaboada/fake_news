MSNBC counter-terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance, who called for ISIS to bomb Trump Tower Istanbul earlier this year, said Wednesday on MSNBC the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise is â€oewhat happens when you have an over proliferation of guns.â€ â€oeThe most important thing we need to understand from this is this is what happens when you have an over proliferation of guns,â€ Nance told Brian Williams, â€oeand it is to be expected to a certain extent.â€ In April, Nance recommended ISIS carry out a â€oesuicide bombingâ€ on Trump Tower Istanbul. â€oeThis is my nominee for the first ISIS suicide bombing of a Trump property,â€ he wrote, retweeting a picture of Trump Tower Istanbul. Nance later deleted the tweet, he never issued an apology nor provided any explanation for his comment. Nance also said last year that Trump was â€oethe ISIS candidateâ€ because he â€oeinflamesâ€ Muslims by criticizing them. The shooter in Alexandria was identified as 66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson, a fervent Bernie Sanders supporter and campaign volunteer who appears to have been radicalized by the hate-filled mainstream media. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said Wednesday on Fox News he believes the shooting was â€oepart of a patternâ€ reflecting the â€oeincreasing intensity of hostility on the left.â€
