Nikki Haley is not one to be messed with. She has effectively developed a reputation as the UN‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s resident badass ambassador in the few short months she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s had the job. On Tuesday, she stared down her colleagues and dropped a brutal truth bomb which left their jaws on the floor. This was long overdue. In a four-minute speech to the Human Rights Council (UNHRC) as it opened its three-week summer session in Geneva, Haley announced that the U.S. was ‚Äoelooking carefully‚Äù into its role on the Council and is seriously considering withdrawing from the body on human rights altogether because it is ‚Äoeso corrupt.‚Äù ‚ÄoeThe United States is looking carefully at this Council and our participation in it,‚Äù Haley told the Geneva forum in her highly-anticipated first address. ‚ÄoeWe see some areas for significant strengthening.‚Äù But, it gets even better. The most important of those areas is what Haley called the Council‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoebiased‚Äù stance on Israel. She said it was ‚Äoehard to accept‚Äù five resolutions passed against the U.S.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s closest ally, all while none whatsoever were considered against Venezuela, which is in the grips of bloody protests over the rule of its president, Nicolas Maduro. It came as the UN‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s top human rights official Zeid Ra‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ad al-Hussein called on Israel to pull out of Palestinian territories captured in 1967. Palestinians want a state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as their capital. The last round of peace talks collapsed in 2014. Now, in a speech opening a three-week session of the UN Human Rights Council, al-Hussein observed the 50th anniversary of when he ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>first heard the sound of war‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> as a boy in Amman, Jordan. He said Palestinians were now marking ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>a half-century of deep suffering under an occupation imposed by military force‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and marked by ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>systematic‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> violations of international law. [Source: Daily Mail] Haley went on to call on the UNHRC to adopt ‚Äoethe strongest possible resolutions on the critical human rights situations in Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Belarus, and Ukraine.‚Äù The Trump administration‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚ÄoeAmerica First‚Äù policy leaves absolutely no room for the UN to push us ‚Ä" or our allies ‚Ä" around any longer. For too many years, the United States has contributed the majority of the UN‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s funding while getting absolutely nothing in return, save for overreaching regulations. As Haley pointed out in her address, the motives of the United Nations and its Human Rights Council are highly questionable. Days after the body voted to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem this December, Trump questioned its effectiveness and branded it ‚Äoea club for people to have a good time.‚Äù If you needed more proof that the UNHRC was nothing more than a very expensive joke, look no further than one of its most controversial members: Saudi Arabia, which was re-elected to the Council last year, despite carrying out 157 executions and preventing women from driving. The days of the UNHRC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s blatant bias are officially over now that Nikki Haley is in town. Donald Trump definitely picked the right person for the job in choosing the former South Carolina Governor as his ambassador. She is currently kicking ass and taking names in Geneva as we speak.
