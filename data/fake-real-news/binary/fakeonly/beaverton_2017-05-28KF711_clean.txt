TORONTO ‚Ä" In a surprise upset yesterday, the Conservative Party of Canada elected a stock photo of a 30-something smiling white man as their party leader. ‚ÄoeWhen it comes to stock photos, this is the only one I trust to run our country,‚Äù said interim party leader Rona Ambrose. ‚ÄoeYou can find it by searching ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>happy friendly white man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> but it also shows up when you search ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>confident good helpful caucasian‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. And with his Creative Commons license, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s free to use, which shows Canadians we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re fiscally responsible.‚Äù The image, which ran under the name ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Andrew Scheer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, has already been photographed with everyday Canadians, proving that just because it was taken with an expensive Canon EOS 5D, that doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mean it can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t connect with constituents. But not everyone in the Conservative Party is convinced. ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just another one of those wealthy elitists,‚Äù said Rich Talmer, a long-time Conservative voter. ‚ÄoeI mean, it was hosted on Getty Images and had over 15,000 downloads. What, is Flickr, the people‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s stock photo website, not good enough for it?‚Äù At press time, no one in the Conservative Party was willing to spend the $5 to get rid of the overlay.
