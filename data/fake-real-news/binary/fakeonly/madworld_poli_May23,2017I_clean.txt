On Monday, leftist reporters thought they had struck gold when they got their hands on a purported ‚ÄoeWhite House document‚Äù showing some rather unusual demands President Donald Trump had supposedly made of his Israeli hosts. The press couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help themselves, and they began tweeting out the document to their followers without ever realizing there was one big problem with it. President Trump and his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, along with their entourage, are currently in the midst of an overseas trip which initially saw them visiting Saudi Arabia for two days before moving on to Israel, where they have been visiting holy sites with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara Netanyahu. Now, the president has kept his schedule packed with notable stops, particularly in Israel, our closest ally. Take, for example, his visit to the Western Wall, a first for a sitting U.S. president. Watch Trump become the first sitting US president to visit The Western Wall #TrumpInIsrael ‚Ä" Business Insider () May 22, 2017 Apparently, those in the media did not feel compelled to cover the most historic and meaningful aspects of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s trip, though, because they opted instead to disseminate a letter claiming to contain the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s list of demands for Israel. The letter first surfaced on Friday via the Twitter account ‚ÄoeRogue White House Senior Advisor.‚Äù That name alone should have been enough to tip reporters off to the fact that it is not actually operated by a real staff member of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s, but it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. Pres has a lot of demands for his Middle East trip. ‚Ä" Rogue WH Snr Advisor () May 19, 2017 The demand letter supposedly contained Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚ÄoeHotel & Catering Requirements,‚Äù which were pretty much all junk food. But, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just one problem; namely, that the document is totally fake. While the account‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s motive remains unclear, its shtick is to share shocking and outlandish ‚Äoeinsider‚Äù stories about Trump while providing no evidence. The account has never provided verification that it is actually run by a White House staffer. Some elements of the purported demands were obvious jokes. The demand that microwaves remain unplugged was a mocking reference to White House advisor Kellyanne Conway‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bizarre comment that the appliance could be used for spying, and the request for electoral maps to be posted on each walls mocked Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tendency to allude to his victory. [Source: Washington Free Beacon] Despite the document being an obvious fake, Jerusalem Post journalist Anna Ahronheim saw the image and believed it was legitimate.

Kessler deleted his tweet when the error was pointed out, and then was forced to begin correcting the record in utter embarrassment. No. ‚Ä" Glenn Kessler () May 22, 2017 If journalism isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t dead, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s definitely in hospice care about to breathe its last breath. It is clear that the media is now so intent on smearing Trump at any costs that they will seize on any and all information put out into the bowels of the internet with absolutely no regard whatsoever to its legitimacy. Ironically, this just helps prove the overwhelming success of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presidency thus far. If all the media can dig up to bash him is an obviously fake document from a Twitter account which is clearly meant to poke fun, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d say he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s doing a pretty damn good job.
