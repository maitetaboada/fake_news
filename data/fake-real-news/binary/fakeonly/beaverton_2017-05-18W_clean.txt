Every week Beaverton editor-in-chief Luke Gordon Field assembles some of the countryâ€<sup>TM</sup>s best comedians and writers to talk, mock and riff their way through the news of the week. Then he puts their knowledge to the test in a very important quiz where the winner gets absolutely nothing. Part panel show, part interview, the Beaverton Weekly Report is an hilarious look at whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s going on in the world around us. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll be just like watching CNN, only funnier and with fewer erectile dysfunction ads. Beaverton editor-in-chief Luke Gordon Field welcomes actress Kristy LaPointe, writer Alexander Saxton and the Beavertonâ€<sup>TM</sup>s foreign correspondent Marilla Wex to discuss international news. Together they riff on the U.K. election (4:00), the fallout from Brexit (8:00), why Labour is failing (13:00), the French election results (17:00), what Angela Merkel is thinking (23:00), and how Donald Trumpâ€<sup>TM</sup>s first international voyage could bring world peace (25:00). And the Approximately 10 Minute Long Quiz gets a little bit sexier than normal. Subscribe: iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, RSS Tags: News, Podcast, weekly report
