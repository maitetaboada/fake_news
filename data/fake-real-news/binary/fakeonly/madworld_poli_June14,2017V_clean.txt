Maxine Waters was at it again, running her big fat mouth, ratcheting up hate against President Donald Trump at a gay pride parade in West Hollywood, California. Waters has been the main instigator against Trump as she lies and spouts innuendos about the president, but this time, she went too far. Something unthinkable happened that she never saw coming, and it will piss you off. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Maxine Waters was delivering her usual spiel of hate and crazed calls for impeachment when she took it too far. Waters, wearing a rainbow bracelet and a Teeny-Bopper shoulderless top with a ‚Äoeresist ‚Äù sign taped to the podium, addressed the LBGTQ community. But, now, her words are coming back to haunt her. ‚ÄoeHe is not my president. He is not your president. He lies. He cheats. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a bully. He disrespects us all. If he thinks he can mess with the LGBT community, he better look at what happened right here in West Hollywood. You deny, you disrespect, and you will find that there are people who have the courage to organize and to take back whatever needs to be taken back,‚Äù said the congresswoman representing the biggest gang infected area in the nation. According to Breitbart, she said, ‚ÄoeWe resist this president because he stands for the worst of everything, he has got to go! And guess what, I know that people may not quite be ready. I know some are a little hesitant. I know some are saying I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not so sure, Maxine, that what you are saying is the right thing, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m saying, impeach 45. Impeach 45.‚Äù What is exactly Maxine Waters saying? Her words that President Trump lies, cheats, and disrespects ‚Äoeus all‚Äù are a build-up to get the audience going, but just what is the fall out of telling whacked out minds that they need to have the courage to take back whatever needs to be taken back? What happens when a nutjob hears her say, ‚ÄoeTrump has got to go‚Äù? Speaker Ryan tells Congress "An attack on one of us, is an attack on all of us" Maybe someone should remind 9 ‚Ä" Katherine Byrd () June 14, 2017 A liberal loon in Alexandria, Virginia, who was a known Trump-hater, took a semiautomatic rifle and shot up a park after confirming there were GOP congressmen playing baseball there. He successfully hit Congressman Steve Scalise in the hip and wounded several others. This is what happens, and Waters is a big player who has caused this climate of hate. ‚ÄoeRep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., specifically blamed ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>political rhetorical terrorism‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> ‚Ä"heated rhetoric on social media and in the news ‚Ä" for Wednesday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shooting, in which House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and several others were wounded,‚Äù reports Fox News. ‚ÄoeThis is the result, I believe, of political rhetorical terrorism. That has to stop,‚Äù he told ‚ÄoeAmerica‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Newsroom.‚Äù The rhetoric coming from Waters, Warren, and Schumer are as responsible for the shooting this morning as the liberal MSM's rhetoric. ‚Ä" Rev. Jack Howell () June 14, 2017 Donald Trump, Jr. and Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) also blamed those like Waters who constantly beat the drum of hate while others like Kathy Griffin and Snoop Dogg post violent images. Donald Trump Jr. re-tweeted, ‚ÄoeEvents like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President.‚Äù Collins didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mention Maxine Waters by name, but he sure aimed his comments in her direction, saying, ‚ÄoeThe rhetoric has been outrageous‚Ä"the finger-pointing, just the tone and the angst and the anger directed at Donald Trump, his supporters. Really, then, you know, some people react to things like that. They get angry as well. And then you fuel the fires.‚Äù After Kathy Griffin and Julius Ceasar, the Russia conspiracy theory, the Left and MSM inspired today's terrorist attack #Alexandria ‚Ä" Jack Posobiec üá∫üá∏ () June 14, 2017 Enough is enough. These losers like Waters know exactly what they are doing, supporting violent images and screaming hateful rhetoric 24/7. Sure, Maxine Waters has free speech, and she won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop, even after this shooting. What we can do is call her out every time she opens her big fat mouth as a violent gangster thug. We make sure Omar Navarro, the young GOP candidate running against her, gets elected. Vote these instigators and agitators all out until every last one of these liberal swamp creatures are gone. They don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t give a damn about America, so I think it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for America to give them all a huge surprise as they lose re-election in 2018.
