Although the left has been doing everything in their power to cover up the fact that the attack in Manchester was carried out by an Islamic terrorist, things just got so much worse for them. As it turns out, a guest on MSNBC recently uttered 3 sick words before the blood on the street could even dry ‚Ä" and it left viewers downright horrified. The incident took place during this morning‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Morning Joe episode on MSNBC after BBC host Katty Kay was invited on for an interview. However, the exchange would take a dark turn that has both America and England outraged ‚Ä" and rightfully so. While discussing the night‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s horrific events, Kay uttered three horrifying words. According to The Daily Caller, the BBC anchor simply said that these senseless killings in the name of Islam are just something that we, as a society, are going to have to ‚Äoeget used to.‚Äù BBC Host ‚Ä" "Europe has to get used to this" #ManchesterBombing ‚Ä" Jack Posobiec üá∫üá∏ () May 23, 2017 ‚ÄoeMothers that they found who are still looking for their daughters, and daughters they found who are still looking for their mothers, and they can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t find the rest of their families,‚Äù Kay began, as she spoke of the aftermath, according to The Gateway Pundit. ‚ÄoeAnd I think that is what is making‚Ä¶ Europe is getting used to attacks like this Mika. We have to because we are never going to totally wipe this out.‚Äù Of course, the moron immediately realized what she just said and tried to immediately backpedal, saying, ‚ÄoeNone of us are used to having children targeted in this way, young girls targeted in this way,‚Äù but it didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t work. The damage was done. However, Kay‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s remarks would only later be made worse as co-host Mika Brzezinski decided to make her biased feelings pertaining to President Donald Trump perfectly clear. According to Washington Free Beacon, Mika was visibly annoyed with President Trump referring to the terrorists responsible as ‚Äoelosers.‚Äù As seen in the clip below, she segued into the conversation by saying, ‚ÄoeJoe, she (The British Prime Minister) called the perpetrator the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>worst of humanity‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and President Trump called him a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>loser,'‚Äù while doing everything in her power not to roll her eyes. However, things certainly didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go as she was hoping they would when co-host Joe Scarborough shot her down saying, ‚ÄoeI think most Americans and most British would agree with both of those assessments.‚Äù Sadly, it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take a genius to see that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right ‚Ä" unless, of course, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re a leftist media hack intent on doing nothing except for destroying the reputation of President Trump. At this point, it can be said with certain confidence that the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hatred for Trump is so severe that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s blinding them to the truth that is right in front of them. Rather than face the real threat to the world ‚Ä" the one actually taking innocent lives ‚Ä" liberals want to bash Trump at every turn. Islam is a threat, and we should never just ‚Äoeget used to dying‚Äù because the left thinks it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s more ‚Äoepolitically correct‚Äù this way. Hoping to stop this exact kind of thinking is what got Trump elected, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s this exact kind of crap that will only result in more bloodshed. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to face the truth. How many more people need to die before the left is willing to say what has been staring them in the face for years now? Fundamental Islam, which commands this type of terror, is a problem ‚Ä" and at this point, it needs to be stopped.
