We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve all seen the picture ‚Ä" the Syrian boy who became the poster child for Aleppo‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s suffering. However, new details have come out almost a year later, and liberals certainly don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want you to know what the father of the boy, who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s featured in the now iconic photograph, has to say now. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no arguing that the left doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why former President Barack Obama was willing to arm terrorists, the Syrian Brotherhood, to oust him from power, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why the left has used whatever tools at their disposal to push their agenda. Proving just that was the iconic picture that went viral, showing a bloody, 5-year-old Syrian boy, named Omran Daqneesh, covered in concrete dust after the building he was in was bombed by pro-Assad forces. At the time, stories were circulating around social media, claiming that Omran‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family had been killed in the blast. Furthermore, they were blaming Assad for the gut-wrenching atrocity. Before long, liberals in America were demanding ‚Äoejustice‚Äù for this boy who they knew nothing about. Of course, the image is rather powerful without context, but who needs that when you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re a liberal? The fact of the matter is that there was much more to this little boy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s story than the left even cared about, and the truth would actually obliterate their narrative around the situation in Syria. According to The Gateway Pundit, Omran‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family most recently appeared in an interview on the news, and they are very well alive. Not only that, but the boy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family still remains loyal to Assad in his fight against Islamic terrorism. Wow. Last year, the White Helmets said Assad bombed this boy. Turns out they lied. He is fine and his family supports the Syrian government. ‚Ä" Sarah Abdallah () June 5, 2017 In fact, Omran‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father states that rebels and international media (i.e. CNN and MSNBC) only wanted to use his son‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s image to attack the Syrian government. Even worse yet, rebels offered him ‚Äoebig amounts of money‚Äù to lie about the Syrian government, but he refused. ‚ÄoeThey wanted to trade in his blood and publish his photos,‚Äù he said, according to ABC News. Omran's father said rebels offered him "big amounts of money" to lie about the Syrian gov't but he refused. This won't be on CNN. #CNNisISIS ‚Ä" Sarah Abdallah () June 5, 2017 When it comes down to it, Omran had only suffered a wound to his head and was mostly just a little dirty. In all, he was discharged from the local hospital within a matter of hours after they patched him up. The boy is alive and still living in Aleppo with his family. Although the left desperately wanted to use this boy as a political prop and turn the world‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s anger on Assad, it didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t work out to their advantage for more than a brief moment in time. The truth always has a way of coming out, and that certainly seems to be the case here. When it comes down to it, war isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fun, and fighting terrorists is even worse. In the end, all these people know is violence, which isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t good news for those whom the cowards are hiding among. Sadly, this is what we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve seen all too many times from the left ‚Ä" a desperate attempt to share ‚Äoenews‚Äù that turns out to be half-baked bias storytelling for a political purpose and outright lies. It is a real shame that so many Americans don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like to use the mush between their ears. Simply believing what you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re told by the media shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be a societal norm, but it is, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly the problem.
