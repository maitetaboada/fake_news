As terrorist attacks continue to unfold in Britain on a weekly basis and liberal politicians do absolutely nothing to help the situation with their politically correct antics and weak stance on radical Islam, the people of cities like London are growing increasingly tired of the situation. The 5-word chant they were heard reciting after the most recent terrorist attack proves as much, but don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expect CNN to tell you about it. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no secret that London‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Muslim Mayor Sadiq Khan is not a fan of President Donald Trump. Last May, Khan even called Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s views on radical Islam ‚Äoeignorant‚Äù and said he was supporting Hillary Clinton for president. We now know how well that worked out for him. Even as extremist Muslims ravage his city, Khan has not backed down from bashing Trump and making excuses for the terrorists who continue to kill innocent citizens. Meanwhile, it is clear to anyone with even the most limited amount of common sense that ‚Äoeradical‚Äù Islam, which if you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve read the Quran is really fundamental Islam, is to blame for the carnage being wrought on the British people. On Sunday, Khan refused to mention Islam, Muslims, or Islamic killers during his comments to the people of London, telling them instead that there was no reason to be alarmed, despite the people dying all around them due to terrorism. At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!" ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 4, 2017 ‚ÄoeLondoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no reason to be alarmed,‚Äù Khan told the media, according to The Gateway Pundit. After all this nonsense, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s easy to understand why Londoners were heard chanting, ‚ÄoeDonald Trump, We Love You!‚Äù over the weekend. Sadiq Khan is an EMBARRASSMENT Londoners chant #Trump's name instead of #MAGA #LondonBridge ‚Ä" Boca Vista () June 5, 2017 Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expect to hear anything about this actual news on CNN, which is far too busy creating fake news to report on legitimate stories. The very same day this report surfaced, CNN was caught red-handed staging pro-Muslim propaganda in London, complete with burqa-clad actors. It would appear that Khan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s chances of being re-elected are getting slimmer and slimmer as the days roll by. At some point, the public will wake up and chose their own safety over political correctness. Perhaps, after three terrorist attacks in as many months, the time for that mental awakening has finally come. Hopefully, it is not too late for the people of Britain to recover from the damage Islam has already done to their once thriving society.
