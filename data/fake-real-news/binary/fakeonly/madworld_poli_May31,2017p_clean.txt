On Tuesday, a horrifying image was released of comedian Kathy Griffin holding the bloody, severed head of what appeared to be President Donald Trump. It was clearly a shameless ploy for attention from the washed up celebrity who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been having a difficult time making headlines lately. Nonetheless, it was extremely offensive, especially to the Trump family. Sadly, the person most deeply affected was the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 11-year-old son, Barron. Barron was at home watching television with his mother First Lady Melania Trump when the image of Griffin holding his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s makeshift severed head appeared on the screen. Immediately fearing the worst and believing that something awful had befallen his beloved dad, Barron screamed for his mom. Trump family sources tell us Barron was in front of the TV watching a show when the news came on and he saw the bloody, beheaded image. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re told he panicked and screamed, ‚ÄoeMommy, Mommy!‚Äù As it was put to us, ‚ÄoeHe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 11. He doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know who Kathy Griffin is and the head she was holding resembled his dad.‚Äù [Source: TMZ] Griffin has since apologized for her blasphemous stunt, saying, ‚ÄoeI moved the line, and then I crossed it. I went way too far. The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people.‚Äù However, the damage had already been done, especially for Barron Trump. Anyone with children can relate to the rage Donald and Melania Trump must feel over their precious young son having to suffer because those on the political left cannot seem to filter themselves. Griffin, though, has no children of her own, which is probably for the better. It is likely that in her haste to blast the president, the demented D-list celebrity didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even consider what might happen were Barron to see the gruesome picture she released. We already know that Melania is a fiercely protective mama bear when it comes to her little boy. She made that clear after Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell tried to humiliate Barron by insinuating that he was autistic. This incident will surely be no different, and Griffin is already beginning to see the consequences of messing with the Trumps. The Democrats seem to have a serious issue with considering the consequences before taking action. Was Griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s stunt worth terrifying an innocent 11-year-old boy? I shudder to think what her honest answer to that question might be, as liberals always seem to find some twisted excuse for their atrocities. To any sane person, the clear answer is a resounding ‚ÄoeNo.‚Äù However, no sane person would have ever done what Griffin did in the first place.
