During a press briefing on Friday morning, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) made another embarrassing gaffe, as we have become accustomed to seeing her do. When an aide approached her and handed her a note, the congresswoman immediately realized her mistake. In what has become somewhat of a reoccurring theme for Pelosi, she again referred to President Donald Trump as President George W. Bush and was subsequently forced to apologize for the blunder. ‚ÄoeFirst, he tries to charm you,‚Äù Pelosi said of President Trump on Friday. ‚ÄoePresident Bush tries to charm you. If that doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t work, he tries to bully you. If that doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t work, he walks away.‚Äù House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) keeps confusing Donald Trump with George W. Bush. During a press briefing on Friday morning, she again referred to ‚ÄoePresident Bush‚Äù when she was discussing Trump. Pelosi may have had Bush on the brain because she said earlier on ‚ÄoeMorning Joe‚Äù that she wished the 43rd president was in the White House now. [Source: Washington Free Beacon] A reporter interrupted Pelosi to say ‚ÄoeTrump‚Äù in an attempt to allow her to correct herself, but she just ignored him and kept right on with her bogus attack on the president. Eventually, after a few minutes had passed, an aide approached the podium with a slip of paper for the congresswoman letting her know that, once again, she had gotten her presidents mixed up. ‚ÄoeI said President Bush? I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sorry, I meant to say‚Ä"it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hard for me to say it,‚Äù Pelosi joked, suggesting she did not want to say ‚ÄoePresident Trump.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄoePoor President Bush. I apologize.‚Äù This is not the first time Pelosi has mistaken President Trump for President Bush. During an April appearance on ABC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s This Week, the House Minority Leader was asked by host Jonathan Karl, ‚ÄoeHow does a Democratic House, you as a Democratic Speaker, work with this president?‚Äù ‚ÄoeI see everything as an opportunity,‚Äù responded Pelosi. ‚ÄoeAnd I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve never seen so much willingness to help win. And winning means winning for the American people, that either we win or whoever wins understands the priorities of the American people. And they are not with President Bush.‚Äù Both times, Pelosi attempted to make her flub into a joke but largely failed, because she just isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t that funny, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really not humorous at all when an elected official doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even know which president they are working under. We are now nearly five months into President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s term and one of the Democratic Party‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s most prominent leaders still seems to be confused about who our Commander-in-Chief is. Either she truly is going senile, as Dick Morris recently suggested, or the left is the biggest bunch of bozos known to man. Perhaps it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a bit of both. Either way, once again, Pelosi has made herself the poster child for term limits. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to retire, Botox Nan.
