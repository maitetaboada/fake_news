On Tuesday, President Donald Trump sent now-former FBI Director James Comey packing. Now, we know who will be replacing Comey, and there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s one thing about him that has Democrats speechless. ‚ÄoeToday, President Donald J. Trump informed FBI Director James Comey that he has been terminated and removed from office,‚Äù read a Tuesday statement from the White House, according to ABC News. ‚ÄoePresident Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.‚Äù The search for a new FBI Director will begin immediately, but in the meantime, Andrew McCabe, who was previously the deputy FBI Director, will be in charge of the nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s preeminent law enforcement agency. McCabe is a Democrat with strong ties to Hillary Clinton, so Democrats have been unable to raise a stink about him, as they have done with every other figure Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s put in charge. Until the administration finds this director, a man strongly connected to the Democratic Party will be in charge. The Democratic Virginia governor‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s PAC donated $467,500 to McCabe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife Jill McCabe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 2015 state Senate campaign. The Virginia Democratic Party also spent a little over $200,000 on the campaign. The now-acting FBI director‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife lost the campaign to the Republican incumbent. After the Wall Street Journal reported these findings, then-candidate Trump said, ‚ÄoeWe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve never had a thing like this in the history of this country.‚Äù At the time, McCabe was leading the probe into Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s use of a private server. [Source: Daily Caller] While this is not particularly good news for Trump supporters, the president is sure to move swiftly in order to find Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s permanent replacement, and his top candidate will make conservatives very happy. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), who gained national fame as a vocal critic of Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s administration and more recently has acted as a much-needed voice of reason in the Democratic fixation on the idea of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s supposed connections to Russia, is currently being touted as a favorite to become Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s successor. Gowdy would be able to turn back the clock on years of questionable investigations and politicized leaks. When he was FBI director, James Comey infamously refused to investigate Hillary Clinton, even though the FBI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own agents clearly determined that she and her team had broken the law and exposed valuable secrets. Trey Gowdy, on the other hand, has never been someone who is afraid to get his hands dirty in the name of justice, which is how he earned himself the nickname ‚ÄoeThe Bulldog.‚Äù Indeed, it is difficult to think of a more fitting candidate for the position vacated by James Comey. Gowdy is precisely the man who can restore faith in the FBI after years of corruption and deceit.
