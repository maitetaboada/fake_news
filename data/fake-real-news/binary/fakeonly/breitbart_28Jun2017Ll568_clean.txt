On Wednesdayâ€<sup>TM</sup>s broadcast of MSNBCâ€<sup>TM</sup>s â€oeMorning Joe,â€ hosts Mika Brzezinski and former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough reacted to White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sandersâ€<sup>TM</sup> criticism of the media by stating President Trump is the greatest liar to ever set foot in the White House and whose lying is â€oeincredibly disturbing.â€ Scarborough said, â€oeI mean, the greatest ironyâ€¦is that this lecture is coming from the greatest liar thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s ever sat in the White House. The New York Times highlighted a thousand lies. I mean, to compare Nixon to this guy is absolutely ridiculous. He lies every day. A lot of times he lies every minute. He forgets the lie that he told five minutes ago.â€ Brzezinski added, â€oeAnd then he props up people like Sarah Huckabee Sanders to back up his lies, and she does it with a straight face. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s incredibly disturbing.â€ (h/t Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter
