Melania and Barron Trump have finally made their big move into the White House. As everyone saw the photos of them being welcomed to their new home over the weekend, it seems Barron‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shirt got most of the attention. However, while all eyes were fixed on his clothing choices, the First Lady posted her first picture from the White House, and it has furious liberals on the attack. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no doubt that the Trump family is beyond overjoyed to be under the same roof once again. Of course, the media has, as expected, found something to complain about. In fact, while they were focused on Barron wearing an ordinary shirt, it took them awhile before they noticed the photo Melania posted from inside the White House. However, when they finally saw it, they immediately began attacking her. Looking forward to the memories we'll make in our new home! #Movingday ‚Ä" Melania Trump () June 12, 2017 After nearly five months of living apart, Melania was undoubtedly excited to have her husband and son under the same roof. In fact, she decided to show her excitement by posting a simple photo on her Twitter account, presumably taken from the presidential living area of the White House and looking toward the Washington Monument, according to Right Wing News. Unfortunately, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all it took for the liberal goons to show their true colors once again as they spewed hateful and pitiful replies, expressing disgust against our nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s First Lady. Don't get too comfortable. ‚Ä" Holly O'Reilly () June 12, 2017 Oh you poor thing. You have to look at him every day now. ‚Ä" Kristina Wong Ô∏è () June 12, 2017 Sorry, I wouldn't unpack. ‚Ä" Tom McClernon () June 12, 2017 Here's to hoping it's a short stay #ImpeachTrump ‚Ä" Muttley Matt 2.0 () June 12, 2017 While all were vile, the following is perhaps the most disrespectful and dishonest of all: The first soft porn star to live there. So touching. ‚Ä" CB () June 12, 2017 Although, as Americans, we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to like the president or his family, there is one thing we all were once expected to do ‚Ä" show respect. Regardless as to whether he was your first choice during the election, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s obvious that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s who the nation, as a whole, voted to lead our country. Sadly, nearly five months after Trump was inaugurated, liberals are still butthurt over the loss. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for them to grow up and accept that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s here for the next four years, if not, eight. There weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t too many conservatives who enjoyed former President Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s leadership, but we endured and simply counted down the days until his departure. Some people in our nation truly need to get a wake-up call and realize that not everything will go their way, and even when it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t, respect is still something they should practice. Regardless of their childlike temper tantrums, the First Family is now happy and Donald Trump is still President.
