Barack and Michelle Obama are intentionally shadowing President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s trip in Europe, hoping to undermine him and steal the limelight. The Obamas, who are acting like they are still in power, will be jetting to Germany to meet with Angela Merkel for a joint event. This event is a ‚Äoeworld leader‚Äù liberal lovefest, and their goal is to attack our president, so Trump is fighting back with a nasty surprise. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Make no mistake, the Obamas are vipers who are actively jetting around Europe in an attempt to undermine President Trump and the First Lady. If you have any doubt, CNN isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hiding the fact that is what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going on, although they sugarcoat it for their favorite couple as the Obamas jet to Germany to meet with Angela Merkel. ‚ÄoeObama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s appearance in Germany will coincide with President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s first trip to Europe and will inevitably promote comparisons about their relative popularity across the Atlantic and their policies,‚Äù reports CNN. The Washington Times headline, ‚ÄoeObama Horns In On Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Foreign Trip,‚Äù also confirms the Obamas‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> nefarious motives for their trip abroad. The Obamas will be joining Angela Merkel at the Brandenberg Gate, which is really a message for President Trump. Just eight years ago Merkel denied former President Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s request to make a speech at the Brandenburg Gate. This gate has the great political symbolism of peace and freedom, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s where Ronald Reagan gave his most famous speech, demanding Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev ‚Äoetear down this wall.‚Äù So, why is Obama allowed to be center stage now in Germany with Merkel? Merkel doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like President Trump and his criticism of her mismanaging the Muslim migrant crisis. Merkel is a globalist, and she is giving the Obamas the big stage at the Brandenberg Gate to launch their Obama Foundation event called ‚ÄoeBeing Involved in Democracy: Taking on Responsibility Locally and Globally.‚Äù Everyone knows this all has been planned to overshadow President Trump, who will be in Italy. But, Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s got a nasty surprise for Barack, Michelle, and Frau Merkel. While they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re at their liberal lovefest promoting globalism and open borders, Trump will be in a Sicilian village called Taormina for the G7 Summit, and that village has suffered greatly from the Muslim migrant crisis. Taormina was ground zero in Sicily for Muslim migrants, and in fact, Sicilians have become famous for their hardcore approach to the crisis. Home to the Costra Nostra Mafia, the crisis got so bad that the mafioso bosses declared war on the Muslim migrants last December. When Trump gets there, he will be greeted warmly and the topic will turn to Islamic Terrorism. Trump won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mention the Obamas by name; he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to. When he gets to Sicily, he will be met by like-minded Italians. The topic will be how Merkel and Obama screwed up Europe with their open borders policy, and sadly, the Manchester attack will now be weighing heavily on everyone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mind. Barack, Michelle, and Merkel will be sitting at the Brandenburg Gate looking like fools as Trump wins again because he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s on the right side of history ‚Ä" the side unwilling to sacrifice innocent lives to Islamic fundamentalism in the name of political correctness. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time Barack Obama comprehends the fact that he and his policies were voted out. Our president is on his first trip abroad, delivering the message we voted for, while they are sitting up at the Brandenburg Gate with Merkel, preaching the message we rejected. President Trump has to be laughing at them as they are so desperate clamoring to stay in power, not realizing they lost all power and relevancy on November 8th, 2016, when Americans voted to send their socialistic agenda packing for good.
