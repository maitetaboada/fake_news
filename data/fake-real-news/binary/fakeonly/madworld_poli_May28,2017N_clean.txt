Life is hard for some people. However, Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) just proved that life is harder when you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re stupid. During a recent press conference, Pelosi was asked about her thoughts on President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s visit to foreign countries, but what came out of her mouth has liberals wishing she would shut her mouth, and rightfully so, as she voiced her dumbest complaint yet. According to The Gateway Pundit, the Democrat representative from Communist California recently answered a few questions at a press conference where she was asked about Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s visit to foreign countries. Oddly enough, she first told the reporter that important political figures and heads of state such as herself make it a point not to talk bad about the President of the United States when they visit other countries. But, in the next sentence, Pelosi tries to trash Trump with a complaint about the order in which he visited foreign countries. Watch and enjoy as Pelosi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s idiocy goes into overdrive: ‚ÄoeI thought it was unusual for the President of the United States to go to Saudi Arabia first. Saudi Arabia?‚Äù Pelosi griped. ‚ÄoeIt wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even alphabetical. I mean, Saudi Arabia.‚Äù You have got to be kidding me. Did Pelosi just overtake Maxine Waters (D-CA) as the dumbest liberal in her party? The House Minority Leader of the United States Congress just complained that our President didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t visit foreign countries in alphabetical order, which leaves many of us to wonder if she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dumber than the people who vote for her. You can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make this stuff up. However, Pelosi didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop there. According to CNS News, she continued with her hysterical complaint by adding, ‚ÄoeNow, notice the previous five presidents‚Ä¶.four of them went to Canada first. And, one of them went to Mexico; George W. Bush went to Mexico first. What was the decision-making process to go to Saudi Arabia first? That is the question I have.‚Äù How can voters in California continue supporting such an idiot? Sure, they are liberals for the most part, but even most liberals don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like to look stupid. Pelosi is an embarrassment to our country and shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make a habit of trying to trash President Trump while she herself has the mental capacity of a goldfish. It is astonishing that so many stupid politicians acquire leadership positions within the Democratic Party. Perhaps it could best be explained in the words of Napoleon Bonaparte: ‚ÄoeIn politics, stupidity is not a handicap.‚Äù
