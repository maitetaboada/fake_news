Reports in Palestinian media in the Strip state that a nine-month-old toddler died in need of urgent medical care in Israel, bringing the number of dead to 12 as of Tuesday afternoon, including six children, three of whom were infants. In the framework of steps taken by the PA against the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip, both Israeli and Palestinian media reported that the PA informed Israeli health services and Israeli authorities that it has stopped funding the hospitalization of Gazans in Israel. A spokesman for the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, Dr. Ashra Alqudra, placed responsibility on the PA in Ramallah for the lives of the patients who cannot receive treatment in Israel. Until recently, Palestinian patients whose medical condition required care at an Israeli hospital were granted special permission to enter Israel while the PA footed the bill. If the PA was late in making payments, Israel would deduct the money from the taxes it collects and hands over to the PA. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhru tweeted, â€oeThe behavior of Mahmoud Abbas and the cessation of transferring patients from the Gaza Strip (to Israel) led to the martyrâ€<sup>TM</sup>s death of many sick children, constituting a crime against humanity. We call for a humanist march to save the Gaza Strip and to stop the schemes of Abbas and Netanyahu to choke Gaza.â€ Ø³Ù,,Ù^Ù<em>f</em> Ù...Ø­Ù...Ù^Ø¯ Ø¹Ø¨Ø§Ø³ Ø¨Ù^Ù,Ù Ø§Ù,,ØªØ­Ù^ÙŠÙ,,Ø§Øª Ø§Ù,,Ø·Ø¨ÙŠØ© Ù,,Ù...Ø±Ø¶Ù °/°° ØºØ²Ø© Ù^Ø§Ù,,Ø°ÙŠ Ø§Ø¯Ù °/°° Ø§Ù,,Ù °/°° Ø§Ø³ØªØ´Ù‡Ø§Ø¯ Ø§Ù,,Ø¹Ø¯ÙŠØ¯ Ù...Ù† Ø§Ù,,Ø£Ø·ÙØ§Ù,, Ù^Ø§Ù,,Ù...Ø±Ø¶ÙŠ ÙŠÙ...Ø«Ù,, Ø¬Ø±Ø§Ø¦Ù...
