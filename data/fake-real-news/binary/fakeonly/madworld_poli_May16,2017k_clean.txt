Nancy Pelosi was recently pressed to justify calls for the impeachment of President Donald Trump, but she simply did not know what to say. In the end, her babbling town hall gibberish appeared to criticize Democrats, or Trump, or someone unknown. No one really understood what she was talking about, and the video is sending liberals into panic mode. Being quite possibly her worst flub yet, you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Red State Watcher reports that there was a moment onstage during Pelosi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s recent town hall that she actually realized she had no idea what she was talking about. She appeared to be trapped between a rock and a hard place when questioned about impeachment, as she admitted that there was no real evidence against Trump, but she did not want to appear to defend him on live television. The Blaze, in an article aptly titled Nancy Pelosi: We Can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t Impeach Trump Just Because We Dislike His Hair, even goes so far as to say that Pelosi was ‚Äoeadmonishing‚Äù Democrats in her comments. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) appeared to admonish Democrats who were calling for the impeachment of President Trump for spurious reasons. She made the comments during a town hall event by CNN Monday. ‚ÄoeYou‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re talking about impeachment,‚Äù she said, ‚Äoeyou‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re talking about ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>what are the facts.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Not, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like him,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like his hair,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> what are the facts? ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like what he said about this‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> ‚Ä" what are the facts that you would make a case on?‚Äù ‚ÄoeWhat are the rules that he may have violated?‚Äù She asked, rhetorically. ‚ÄoeIf you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have that case, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re just participating in more hearsay. And that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the basis of a ‚Ä" and we owe the American people just some stability in all of this.‚Äù ‚ÄoeThis is the time where here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s supposed to be having his honeymoon ‚Ä" what a marriage!‚Äù she joked, to some laughter from the audience. ‚ÄoeSo we watch and see, what he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to do, what is his vision, how is he going to implement the rest,‚Äù she concluded. ‚ÄoeAnd it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been sloppy.‚Äù Watch the comedy for yourself, below: Pelosi on calls to impeach Trump: "We owe the American people ‚Ä¶ some stability in all of this" #PelosiTownHall ‚Ä" CNN () May 16, 2017 For most of us, it is hilarious to watch liberals like Pelosi tap dance when they are forced to tell the truth. It is sad to think that she had held a leadership post in Congress for years and that there are people who actually attempt to follow her lead. It is becoming apparent that Democrats know that their old, tired, deceptive tactics have lost power over the American electorate, and they are scrambling to make sense of how to implement their liberal agenda in the age of Trump. People are tired of the dishonesty, and they prefer the authenticity that a leader like Trump presents, even if it is unconventional. For those of us who enjoy watching Democrats like Pelosi squirm, it is a great time to tune in, as they are certainly doing a lot of it.
