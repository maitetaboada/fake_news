Shocking new information is coming out on DNC Staffer Seth Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s murder case. After months of speculation, investigators finally have hardcore evidence that he was murdered and targeted, proven by the series of phone calls he made just minutes before his death. Even more shocking, Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s murder is now linked to those currently trying to destroy President Donald Trump. This will truly blow your mind. Fox News is reporting that Seth Rich was in contact with WikiLeaks. The 27-year-old computer expert, who worked for the DNC, was murdered, shot twice in the back without anything of value taken from him. Rich was found alive and in shock, before he bled out and his death ruled nothing more than a botched robbery. Julian Assange is offering a $20,000 dollar reward for any information that leads to Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s killer. Many believe Rich was a victim of retaliation for being the source who provided WikiLeaks with a trove of DNC emails. Rumors were fueled by the odd circumstances surrounding his death, the sudden retirement of Washington, D.C., Police Chief Cathy Lanier five weeks after the murder, and an email John Podesta sent to Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s inner circle about making an example out of a suspected leaker. Podesta: "I'm definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it." ‚Ä" WikiLeaks () October 30, 2016 Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s where it gets very interesting, tying into current events surrounding President Donald Trump. The motive for the leaks was obvious ‚Ä" the collusion within the DNC, specifically with the U.S. media, to eliminate Bernie Sanders as a potential risk to Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ambitions. But remember, the DNC is claiming it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the Russians who hacked them, not Seth Rich. Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the real kicker in this case. The DNC refused the FBI and the CIA any access to their servers after the so-called hacking by the Russians. Isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t that crazy? Instead, they paid a group called ‚ÄoeCrowdstrike‚Äù to ‚Äoeinvestigate‚Äù the hack, and it was Crowdstrike who said that ‚Äoeit was the Russians.‚Äù This is vital to know: the FBI and CIA used Crowdstrike‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s reports to substantiate their claims that it was the Russians who hacked the DNC. Something very wrong is going on here. But, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not all. Breitbart reports, ‚ÄoeSome critics of that view [Russia hacked the DNC], however, suggested that the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Russian hack‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> may have been an inside job by a disgruntled Bernie Sanders supporter or a rogue campaign staffer, in part or in whole.‚Äù Now, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s become clear that the disgruntled Sanders supporter was Seth Rich. BOMBSHELL REPORT: Slain DNC staffer Seth Rich had contacted Wikileaks right before his murder. #SethRich #WikiLeaks ‚Ä" Newt-Trump Fan Club () May 16, 2017 ‚ÄoeIn the aftermath of the shooting, the Rich family hired a private investigator ‚Ä" Rich Wheeler, a former D.C. homicide detective who says evidence on Seth Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s laptop suggests he was in contact with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Of note, Wheeler does not have possession of the laptop in question ‚Ä" however, he said specific information will be released on Tuesday (5/16),‚Äù reports Zero Hedge. Furthermore, Wheeler believes there has been a cover-up. ‚ÄoeThe police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,‚Äù said Wheeler. ‚ÄoeThey haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.‚Äù When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, ‚ÄoeAbsolutely. Yeah. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s confirmed.‚Äù ‚ÄoeI have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t share any information with you.‚Äù [Source: Fox 5] This could potentially blow up the whole bogus Russian-Trump collusion case. It was well-known in political circles inside Hillary‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign that they manufactured the fake Russia excuse. ‚ÄoeIn the Clinton campaign tell-all, Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Doomed Campaign, reveals how Hillary Clinton personally placed blame for her bruising defeat on Russian meddling ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>within twenty-four hours of her concession speech,'‚Äù reports Breitbart. Here, we have the smoking gun that implicates Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign in a murder and proves President Donald Trump is innocent of any wrongdoing. Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pray that Seth Rich didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t die in vain. He had his whole life ahead of him, and he was trying to do the right thing. Patriots have the power to make sure this information is spread far and wide; we deserve the truth, and so does Seth Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family.
