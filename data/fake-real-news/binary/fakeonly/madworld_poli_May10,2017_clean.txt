Sources within the White House are disclosing that President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s firing of FBI Director James Comey is sending a secret message to John McCain. Not only that, but rumors from the mainstream media that Comey was requesting additional resources to investigate Russia collusion is turning out to be a huge lie that McCain leaked. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be shocked at McCain‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disloyalty and how Trump has set him straight for good. President Donald J. Trump fired now-former FBI Director James Comey to send a message to Senator John McCain, sources close to the White House confirm. Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s firing is a direct rebuke to McCain‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s control over the nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s defense, White House staffers confirm. Earlier this year, McCain went after Trump with widely discredited opposition research that he immediately shared with Comey, his longtime friend. Comey worked with McCain to go after businessman Jack Abramoff after Abramoff stopped McCain from winning the Republican Primary in 2000. McCain had since been working with now-former FBI Director Comey to help undermine President Trump since Trump was elected. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a method to McCain‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s madness, as McCain has used his position as chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services to veto Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s national defense picks. McCain went so low, he undermined Trump by comparing the president to Richard Nixon during Watergate. ‚ÄoeI remember the Saturday Night Massacre,‚Äù McCain told the mostly European and American guests, referring to the 1973 incident when President Nixon fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor looking into the Watergate break-in. If that isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bad enough, McCain is the source of a massive leak that has no basis in fact. Trying to stir up trouble, he leaked to the press that Comey had requested additional resources to investigate collusion with Russia. The liberal loons are running around using this bogus information as proof that Trump fired Comey over the fake Russian scandal that they keep trying to push. ‚ÄoeEarlier, multiple reports broke that James Comey had asked the Department of Justice for additional funding for the Russia probe that has plagued the Trump administration since before Donald Trump took office. However, DOJ officials are going on the record denying the claim,‚Äù reports Red State. Deleted "resources"/"money" tweet ‚Ä" CNN tweet was misleading. CNN article says DOJ denies Comey asked for anything. 1 ‚Ä" Daniel Dale () May 10, 2017 A Justice Department spokeswoman said it is ‚Äoetotally false‚Äù that Comey had asked the deputy attorney general for additional resources for the Russia investigation in the days before he was fired. Even the New York Times was citing three anonymous sources for this claim, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s obvious one of those leakers came from the McCain camp. It seems to be more clear why, in the letter Trump wrote to Comey firing him, the president included an odd phrase that seemed out of place. Trump wrote, ‚ÄoeWhile I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.‚Äù Trump knew that the liberal scumbags would come out and immediately lie, saying he fired Comey to stop some nonexistent investigation into Trump and Russia, so he included that line in Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s termination letter. All that has ever been proven is that possibly Russia hacked into the Democratic National Committee‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s servers, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s it. Nothing else has ever been proven because there is simply no collusion by Trump; it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a made-up story to try to take him down. McCain needs to heed what happened to Comey. Although Trump can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fire him, he can make his life difficult and have him taken off the defense committees that he loves. McCain gets massive amounts in kickbacks from defense contractors, and that needs to stop. Honestly, he needs to retire already. Sometimes, it would be nice if the trash just took itself out. McCain is as corrupt as Comey; it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to drain the swamp some more and say goodbye to ole John McCain.
