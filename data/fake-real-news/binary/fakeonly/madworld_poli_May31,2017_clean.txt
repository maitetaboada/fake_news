Sicko Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell is at it again, this time going way too far by attacking 11-year-old Barron Trump. Barron became very frightened when an image of his dad ‚Äoebeheaded‚Äù flashed on his TV screen, which turned out to be the horrendous attention-seeking ploy of Kathy Griffin. Now, patriots are getting revenge on Rosie for being a jerk to the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s son, who was rightfully scared by the disturbing photo. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be shocked by just how low Rosie went. After an image went viral depicting comedian Kathy Griffin holding up a fake, severed and bloody head of President Donald Trump, a photo that forced her to issue a video apology, a story emerged claiming that Barron Trump had seen the photo on TV and panicked, thinking it was actually his dad. It only took about five seconds for the anti-Trump trolls on Twitter to crawl out from under their bridges and start lobbing insults at the boy, but one that stood out was from Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell, who is obsessed with Donald Trump. -was he watching TMZ? do u think he saw anything about these 2 heroic men who died defending young girls? hatred promoted by his father?#USA ‚Ä" ROSIE () May 31, 2017 Rosie is talking about the Portland murderer, Jeremy Christian. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s got one huge problem using him as someone associated with Trump. ‚ÄoeRosie leaves out that the man who stabbed these two to death was a Bernie Sanders supporter, so using Barron‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fear to shame Trump over that incident is just more ugly hate,‚Äù reported Twitchy. Unfortunately, Rosie spurred other idiots to tweet hate for an eleven-year-old boy, too. #BarronTrump is a fucking idiot and no one is surprised ‚Ä" celine dijon mustard () May 31, 2017 #BarronTrump is such a snowflake Ô∏èIf he actually lived at White House, he would know that his father is alive & slowly destroying the world ‚Ä" Santiago Svidler () May 31, 2017 Wednesday morning, President Trump lashed out at Kathy Griffin for ‚Äoedecapitating‚Äù him, saying his kids, especially his youngest son, are having a difficult time with the gory image of the comic holding their father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bloody head. ‚ÄoeKathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11-year-old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!‚Äù he tweeted. Then, Donald Trump Jr. decided to weigh in, along with other patriots who are sick that Griffin not only did this but also shocked that lowlifes would take pleasure in it causing a young boy unnecessary, emotional trauma. Disgusting but not surprising. This is the left today. They consider this acceptable. Imagine a conservative did this to Obama as POTUS? ‚Ä" Donald Trump Jr. () May 30, 2017 wow Rosie, Ur an ungrateful twit.. where were U when DJT gave his jet to fly a sick kid and equipment from west to east coast for treatment ‚Ä" Patrick Chesbro () May 31, 2017 poor rosie ‚Ä" such a hasbeen. If you put forth as much effort towards your family as you do staying relevant. So lame. ‚Ä" Sandy McCloud () May 31, 2017 First Lady Melania Trump also weighed in by directly making a statement about Kathy Griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mental health. ‚ÄoeAs a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,‚Äù Melania Trump said in a statement Wednesday. ‚ÄoeWhen you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.‚Äù Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell and Kathy Griffin are both mentally unstable. Rosie‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own daughter has accused her of abuse, saying she chased her with a wine bottle and tore off her clothes looking for a tattoo. Rosie has no life it seems; she is literally on Twitter 24/7 and can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop her strange obsession with the president. As for Griffin, she has always been off mentally. She was banned from multiple talk shows, including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Ellen, and even The View. With her career in the dumpster, she finally jumped the shark for good with the beheading stunt. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for those who hate the Trump family so much to move out of the country. If they are so hard up for a cheering American crowd, then they should just leave the country. No doubt Americans would be applauding as Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell and Kathy Griffin left the United States for good. It would likely be the most applause they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve gotten in their entire careers.
