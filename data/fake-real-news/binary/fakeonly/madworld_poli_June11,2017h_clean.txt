London‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Muslim Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has made his hatred of President Donald Trump known far and wide, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all over Khan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s denial of Islamic terrorism. Khan has criticized Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Muslim travel ban, calling him ‚Äoeracist‚Äù and trying to get him banned from London. Now, the queen is speaking out, sick of Khan too. Queen Elizabeth II is backing Trump in a very public way that is humiliating Khan, big time. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll love this. Khan allegiance is to Islam first, and he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s so arrogant, he thinks he speaks for all the United Kingdom, but he couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be more wrong. While the queen is not the ultimate ruler of England anymore, she has certain duties and responsibilities to the citizens. One is as a goodwill ambassador as a head of state, and she wields much political power behind the scenes. Apparently, she is sick and tired of Sadiq Khan and his handling of the Muslim migrants, which he has welcomed in the thousands since he was sworn in as London‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mayor. Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s be clear, the queen is against the Islamization of England, and she is going over the heads of Sadiq Khan and Prime Minister Thersa May, as her royal invitation to Donald and Melania Trump still stands. This is extremely embarrassing for that nitwit Khan. ‚ÄoeFollowing a heated feud between Trump and London Mayor Sadiq Khan regarding recent terror attacks in London, some were calling on Prime Minister Theresa May to cancel the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s visit with the queen. Unfortunately for these Trump-haters, the British government has reiterated the invitation to Trump,‚Äù AFP reported. The U.K. Guardian also reported that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson addressed the push by Khan and others to rescind the invitation to Trump, during an appearance on the BBC. ‚ÄoeThe invitation has been issued and accepted and I see no reason to change that,‚Äù Johnson stated. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked to weigh in on the back-and-forth in Britain regarding Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s upcoming visit and Khan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s demand that it be canceled, but he kept his answer short and sweet, Breitbart reported. ‚Äoe(The president) appreciates Her Majesty‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s gracious invitation,‚Äù Spicer said. ‚ÄoeWhile Trump and Khan have been at odds since during the 2016 campaign, the feud was reignited following the London Bridge terror attack, which had Khan reassuring Londoners that there was ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>no reason to be alarmed‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> at the increased presence of armed police officers in the city streets,‚Äù reports Truthfeed. Trump seized on that remark and slammed Khan for making such a ridiculous statement after a terror attack. Khan looks like an idiot after bashing all of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s warnings about Islamic terrorism, and there is little doubt where the queen stands ‚Ä" she wants Britain to retain its culture and not be overrun by Muslim migrants. Trump tweeted about the mayor‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s seemingly incongruous remark about the police presence in London following the attack. ‚ÄoePathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>no reason to be alarmed‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> statement,‚Äù Trump tweeted on Monday. ‚ÄoeMSM is working hard to sell it!‚Äù It is indisputable that the U.S. and U.K. have a close friendship, supported by long-standing bonds, though some would argue that the relationship has been weakened somewhat by the British left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s reaction to President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s election. Unfortunately for England‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s liberals who wish otherwise, the queen is welcoming President Trump and Melania in October, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not going to change. She is sending the citizens of Great Britain a message by having the president for an official royal visit after so many like Khan have tried to ban Trump. The message is, she sides with Trump, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for those who rule that island nation to wake up before it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s too late.
