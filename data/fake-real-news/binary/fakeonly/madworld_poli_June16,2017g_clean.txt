Drivers in New York were shocked to see something out of the ordinary while driving through liberal New York. As it turns out, someone got a bright idea to make a few changes to a local sign ‚Ä" and just two words left Trump-hating motorists downright furious as the altered sign popped up overnight. The occurrence took place along the Sagtikos Parkway in Long Island, New York, after someone had a stroke of genius. In fact, it seems that the witty resident saw the Crooked Hill Road exit sign and figured out something he could do to take a dig at every liberal who passed it, The American Mirror reports. With the sign originally reading, ‚ÄoeCrooked Hill Rd,‚Äù it only took just two modifications to make it read something else that would make any liberal‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s blood boil. The comical prankster put an ‚ÄoeA‚Äù in the space between ‚ÄoeHill‚Äù and ‚ÄoeRd,‚Äù then covered up the ‚Äoed‚Äù with a ‚ÄoeY,‚Äù making the sign read ‚ÄoeCrooked Hillary.‚Äù A sign marking the Crooked Hill Road exit on the Sagtikos Parkway was defaced to ‚ÄoeCrooked Hillary,‚Äù officials said ‚Ä" Newsday () June 15, 2017 As one would imagine, the sign was met with equal parts praise and condemnation as motorists drove by. With supporters of President Donald Trump getting a good chuckle out of it, enraged liberals were calling police left and right in order to have the changes reversed immediately. Although New York is known for being a liberal state, for those unaware, upstate New York is heavily Republican as any electoral map will show it lit up in red. However, the fact that New York City is so densely populated, the small section is able to override the vast majority of the state, rendering the state blue during elections. With that being said, you can imagine how the Hillary-loving communist officials down in NYC took the subtle dig. ‚ÄoeAs soon as we were notified about the graffiti yesterday morning, it was removed,‚Äù a Department of Transportation spokesperson told the NY Daily News on Thursday. ‚ÄoeDefacing public signs is illegal.‚Äù At this point, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not clear how many days the beautiful homage brought smiles to the faces of sparse Conservatives in the area, but the nickname is far from being forgotten. In fact, Trump himself most recently resurrected Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nickname as recently as yesterday in a tweet. Explaining that Democrats were on a ‚Äoewitch hunt‚Äù to find him guilty of anything, he told the American people that ‚ÄoeCrooked Hillary‚Äù had actually been complicit in criminal behavior. Not only that but since the left wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t been able to prove so-called ‚Äoecollusion‚Äù between Trump and Russia, they migrated to an investigation into ‚Äoeobstruction.‚Äù Hillary, on the other hand, had taken part in many illegal activities, which other people are currently in prison for doing similar. When it comes down to it, Trump is absolutely right ‚Ä" the left is grasping at straws in hopes of tarnishing his reputation. Unfortunately for them, their greatest hero is perhaps the dirtiest politicians to ever run for the Oval Office. In the end, the real criminal is ‚ÄoeCrooked Hillary‚Äù not President Trump, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s abundantly clear that most of the nation knows it. In fact, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s that reason that the left wants to shift focus from Hillary at all costs. Not only are they embarrassed by her inability to hold herself accountable, but she would have been impeached had she been elected, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s got to leave a bad taste in their mouth. Too bad for them, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll just have to get used to seeing Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face because he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not going anywhere ‚Ä" no matter how hard they try.
