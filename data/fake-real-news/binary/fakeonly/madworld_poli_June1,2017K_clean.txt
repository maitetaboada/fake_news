President Donald Trump showed members of our armed forces exactly what he thinks of them during his recent Memorial Day speech. Although his appreciation for our servicemembers gained a lot of attention, something else is now all the talk after a few keen eyes picked up on something previously missed as a photo caught a mystery man standing just feet away from the president ‚Ä" and people have been left utterly horrified to learn who he is. Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, was absolutely packed on Memorial Day as President Trump was set to make an appearance, paying tribute to fallen servicemembers who died protecting America. However, something disturbing took place during the Wreath Laying Ceremony as a man was pictured just feet away from the President at the time. President Donald Trump visited Arlington National Cemetery on the holiday to honor the US service members who made the ultimate sacrifice. He was joined by Vice President Mike Pence, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Joseph Dunford and Secretary of Defense James Mattis. [Source: Fox 8 Cleveland] Unfortunately, the day took a horrifying turn ‚Ä" and it happened when all eyes were on Trump. According to Fox News, the FBI is looking for a man accused of making sexual contact with a minor during the event. Even worse yet, he used the distraction of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s appearance to carry out his sick plan. As law enforcement personnel explain, the man is a Hispanic male, approximately 5‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>5‚Ä≥ to 5‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>7‚Ä≥ tall. Providing a bit more detail into the man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s appearance, officials also state that he is believed to be between 50 and 60 years old with ‚Äoeshort, spikey, grey and black hair.‚Äù At this time, the disturbing monster has avoided being found by police. Anyone with information is urged to contact the FBI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Washington field office at 202-278-2000 or by submitting a tip on the FBI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s website. It takes a tremendous amount of effort to successfully protect the President of the United States, and for the Secret Service to protect everyone at such an event would be impossible. With that being said, the American people are extremely resilient and resourceful. Of course, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s with that in mind that the FBI has asked for the public‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s help in finding this pervert before he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s able to victimize any more innocent and defenseless children. It takes an especially sick kind of monster to take advantage of a little girl while everyone else‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attention is affixed elsewhere. Ironically, this man took advantage of the very thing he was in Arlington to memorialize ‚Ä" his freedom. Now, because he couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care less about the people who died to protect his rights, he is about to lose his freedom. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only a matter of time before this disgusting excuse for a human being is caught and locked away in a cage like he belongs.
