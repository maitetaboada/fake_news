Aspen Institute President and CEO Walter Isaacson, who previously served as Chairman and CEO of CNN and as TIME Magazine‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Editor, stated that the number of on-camera White House press briefings could be reduced and that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s good to have off-camera discussions because people perform when they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re on-camera. Isaacson began by saying, ‚ÄoeYou know, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really important for people to just think carefully and say, I know the difference between fake news and real news, and I know the difference when somebody makes a mistake. CNN made a mistake recently, and then corrected it. And if we start deciding that anything we disagree with is fake news, you lose the trust, the whole thing breaks down and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really one of the really bad things we are facing as a society.‚Äù He later added, ‚ÄoeI think the on-camera briefings could be cut back. I ithink it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really good to have sort of off-camera, people discussing things, some for the print press, even if it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not on camera. I think on-camera, everybody performs.‚Äù Isaacson concluded, ‚ÄoeAnd also, the jousting with the press secretary done on-camera doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really get us that far to understanding things better. ‚Ä¶ A once a week presidential press conference makes total sense. ‚Ä¶ That would be good. And then I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d say, background briefings for an hour or two, really long briefings where people actually tell the truth from the white house, the press, and ‚Ä" instead of trying to joust on-camera.‚Äù (h/t WFB) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter
