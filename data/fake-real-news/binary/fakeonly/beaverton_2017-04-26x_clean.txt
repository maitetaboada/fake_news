OTTAWA ‚Ä" After a four month long pitch to Canada‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s panel of esteemed Conservative voters, the business savvy nation stated that Kevin O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Leary‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s purported valuation was ‚Äoeway off‚Äù and that they couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t in good conscience invest in a general election. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m out,‚Äù said almost everyone in Canada, who has almost 150 years of business experience and a GDP of over $1.5 trillion. ‚ÄoeYou can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t speak French even though you were born in Quebec, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re so distracted with your other businesses and ventures that you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not even focusing on your pitch to me, oh, and your rhetoric! Honestly, you seem like a guy trying his hardest to imitate a guy doing literally the worst impression of Donald Trump. I just can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m out.‚Äù Former colleague and Dragon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Den star, Arlene Dickinson, who was also on the panel of potential Canadian voters said, ‚ÄoeI was out as soon as he walked into the room. This guy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only here for himself. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s already left a bad taste in my mouth, just like his wines.‚Äù ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m definitely out,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄoePersonally, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve known Kevin a long time,‚Äù said Jim Treliving, owner of Boston Pizza. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m really surprised it took everyone this long to figure out what a self-serving blowhard he is. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m out too.‚Äù ‚ÄoeScrew this!‚Äù said O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Leary after being rejected by the country of 35 million. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going back to the United States, where people reward unbridled selfishness and greed!‚Äù Tags: business, Canada, CBC, Conservative, Conservative Leadership, Conservative Leadership Race, Conservative Party, Conservative Party Leadership, Conservative Party of Canada, CPC, Dragons Den, Investment, Kevin O'Leary, leadership, ottawa, politics, Shark Tank, valuation
