President Donald Trump is wrapping up his first foreign trip abroad, and we are just learning that he and First Lady Melania slipped out of sight for a few hours in Israel. Where the Trumps went and what they did is being blacked out by the mainstream media as liberals freak out, fearful that Americans will find out the truth. Luckily, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve just uncovered the facts about this secret trip, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s something you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to love. President Donald Trump has become the scariest man alive, according to the mainstream media. The constant drumbeat that Trump is evil, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a Nazi, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a racist is spewed 24/7 on outlets like MSNBC and CNN. What Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enemies fear the most is any evidence that contradicts their set narrative that they have sold to the liberal loons who buy every word they say. So, when President Trump slipped away for a few hours while in Israel, of course, the press corp traveling with him knew exactly what he was up to, but the word went out to black it out. Thanks to Yeshiva News, we know where he went, as they report, ‚ÄoeDuring his recent visit to Israel, President Donald Trump made a 14-year old girl‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dream come true. Emilee Imbar has been battling cancer for the last seven years, and has dreamed of meeting with the U.S. President.‚Äù ‚ÄoeShimi Geshayed, Director of Rachashei Lev together with long time Rachashei Lev supporter, Prime Minister Benjamen Netanyahu, were able to facilitate a meeting between Emilee and President Trump that neither of them are sure to forget. Despite the Presidents overwhelmingly packed schedule on his 27 hour trip to Israel, he was eager to meet this special girl and make her dream come true,‚Äù reported Yeshiva News. Can you imagine if this was Barack and Michelle Obama? The media hacks would be all over this story, making sure they rammed it down our throats. As Daily Wire reports, ‚ÄoeThere would have been dozens of reports about it, with swooning reporters weeping as they praised Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s deep empathy and humility. More likely still, Obama would have made sure there were cameras on hand to capture his caring act. But Trump didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do that ‚Ä" and the MSM didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t say a word. Amazing.‚Äù The Trumps slipped away and did not alert the mainstream media of their whereabouts. They aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t politicians, spending every waking moment in a photo-op. The real story here that the anti-Trump media is blacking out is that Donald Trump is a good person. If that got out, liberal heads would explode and their zombie-like followers might break ranks and start questioning everything they say. Donald Trump is not perfect, he is human. But, by all accounts, he is a very generous and good human being. He really has no act, like other politicians. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why the vast majority of Americans trust him. Melania Trump may be shy, and probably being First Lady was not her dream, but she has shown great fortitude and character. Most people don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t now she has frequently visited sick children in the hospital. Like this trip, those trips were not publicized. Americans can finally be proud of the First Family which is showing grace and kindness, especially when the cameras aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t rolling.
