As former FBI Director James Comey testified on Capitol Hill, it was a politically charged circus of Democrat vs. Republican with Comey thinking he was the prom king, but he came across as a big drama queen. Comey got ‚Äoechewed up and spit out‚Äù by two seasoned GOP senators after he ‚Äoelied his a** off‚Äù about President Donald Trump. Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lies backfired on him, and he might end up looking at prison time. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. What patriots need to understand about these hearings on Capitol Hill is these snakes in the Democratic Party are trying to invent a charge against President Trump of ‚Äoeobstruction of justice‚Äù so they can impeach him. But, after the bombshells dropped, where Comey was caught lying and leaking information to the press during this hearing, Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attorney is now stating Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s testimony can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be trusted at all. Not only did Comey admit to being a leaker, he admits to leading an army of leakers created to damage President Trump. ‚Ä" Bill Mitchell () June 8, 2017 But, we will get to that later. First, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll show how Comey lied, badly. Drama Queen Comey tried to take revenge on Trump during the hearing by saying, ‚ÄoeI took it as a direction‚Äù that the president wanted him to ‚Äoeend the Flynn investigation.‚Äù GOP Senator Risch played Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s game and said to Comey, ‚ÄoeWords matter. You wrote down the words [referring to Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s memo] so we can all have the words in front of us now. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 28 words now in quotes. It says, quote, I hope ‚Ä" this is the president speaking ‚Ä" ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Now, those are his exact words, is that correct?‚Äù Comey replied, ‚ÄoeCorrect.‚Äù Risch then made the point that the president never ordered Comey to do anything. The president was expressing a ‚Äoehope,‚Äù a hope for his friend Flynn who he just had to fire, a hope things don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go too badly for Flynn because he is a good guy. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Comey who claims he is inside the mind of Trump and knows that Trump meant that as an order to stop Flynn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s investigation. Crazy? You bet. Here are Senator Risch‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exact words to Comey that caused a hush to come over that cavernous courtroom: He said, I hope. Now, like me, you probably did hundreds of cases, maybe thousands of cases, charging people with criminal offenses and, of course, you have knowledge of the thousands of cases out there where people have been charged. Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice or, for that matter, any other criminal offense, where they said or thought they hoped for an outcome? [Source: Vox] That was the drop mic moment. Comey looked down and swallowed hard, looking like a teen girl wanting to cry. Comey also admitted that he was the leaker who gave the New York Times his ‚Äoememo‚Äù of his exchanges with President Trump. Oh, Comey got caught in a big lie there. Comey said he leaked the memo due to a Trump tweet, except that tweet was posted the day after the NY Times was quoting from his leaked memo, proving not only is Comey a leaker but he lied under oath. What a punk move that was, proving Comey is just out to hurt the president, and so he goes and leaks info to the New York Times, which brings us to another gotcha moment for Comey. The fact Comey leaked his own memos so casually tells me it was a behavior with which he had grown accustomed. ‚Ä" Bill Mitchell () June 8, 2017 Little Marco Rubio came through for Trump today, too, as he made Comey look like an idiot, pointing out with all the leaks out there, including leaks from the big leaker James Comey, why is the only thing that has never been leaked to the press is that Trump was not under investigation? Rubio said, ‚ÄoeYou ever wonder why the only thing that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s never been leaked is the fact that the president was not personally under investigation?‚Äù Comey looks like a deer in the headlights, with the whole shocking exchange below. Patriots can stand tall knowing they keep coming for Trump, and they keep striking out. Doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t anyone care about getting this country back on track? Oh, yeah, President Trump does. We the People do. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to stop all this crazy Russia-Trump conspiracy and let the president do his job. All those swamp creatures who were on Capitol Hill today better get on board the Trump train. If not, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll find themselves like James Comey, a disgruntled ex-government employee traitor.
