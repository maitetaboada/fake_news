Kellyanne Conway, the Senior Adviser to President Donald Trump, was treated like dirt by Anderson Cooper during a live TV interview. Cooper kept rolling his eyes in a very visible and condescending way as Kellyanne was trying to answer his questions. Not one to be bullied, Kellyanne is striking back, and she just got some sweet revenge, letting everyone know how Anderson Cooper is one big liar. In case you missed it, ‚Äoehard news‚Äù reporter Anderson Cooper acted like a big bully, rolling his eyes while Kellyanne Conway calmly tried to answer his idiotic questions about President Donald Trump firing James Comey. It was so bad that Cooper‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s juvenile behavior made headlines, and despite his actions, Kellyanne soldiered on through the interview. Later, when asked about his obnoxious behavior, Kellyanne let everyone know one thing about Cooper, he is a phony and a liar. Cooper loves to identify himself as a forward thinking man who values women‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rights, and he even claims to be a feminist. Well, as Kellyanne tells it, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all show. Cooper is one of the biggest misogynists out there. ‚ÄoeLet‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s put this in context. He had me sit through a bunch of tapes showing then candidate Trump commending Jim Comey about Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s emails, talking about him, etc. The fact is that they showed all these clips and they showed candidate Trump in Grand Rapids, Michigan. And I said thanks for the trip down memory lane and talked about winning Michigan. And then he rolled his eyes,‚Äù Kellyanne explained. ‚ÄoeAnd let me tell you something. Hillary Clinton is in search of sexism as a lame excuse for why her disastrous candidacy and campaign lost six months ago. I face sexism a lot of times when I show up for interviews like that,‚Äù added Kellyanne. WATCH: reacts to Anderson Cooper's eyeroll ‚Ä" FOX & friends () May 11, 2017 Where are all the feminists coming to Kellyanne‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s defense? Where‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donell, Ashley Judd, or even Hillary Clinton? How about those hags on ‚ÄoeThe View‚Äù? Not one of them has anything to say to Anderson Cooper who insults the first woman to run a major presidential campaign and win. Well, there it is, proof positive that liberals are a bunch of phonies only acting nice to those who matter to them. Anderson Cooper spends large amounts of time looking in the mirror as he was caught doing by Los Angeles radio hosts ‚ÄoeJohn and Ken.‚Äù He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s so arrogant, he is the only anchor at CNN that slaps away staffers who try to fix his hair, reported New York Daily News. Too bad he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t look past his average looks and take an inventory of why he is such a jackass. This is EPIC! Watch Anderson Cooper caught LYING to his audience to protect Hillary. CNN is the very essence of #fakenews #ObamaFarewell ‚Ä" Deplorable Melissa () January 12, 2017 Well, what do we expect from a fake liberal who grew up with millions? Cooper is the son of heiress Gloria Vanderbilt and his family is old money worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Unlike Kellyanne, who grew up poor or Donald Trump who worked for the millions he has, Cooper is just a pampered rich kid who wanted to be on TV, doing ‚Äoehard news.‚Äù So, he might want to stop rolling his eyes at a woman who worked damn hard to get to the White House. All he had to do was to be born to the rich and famous. Anderson Cooper would be flattened by Kellyanne Conway in a hot second. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lucky she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t pop him right in the eyes during his infamous eye roll.
