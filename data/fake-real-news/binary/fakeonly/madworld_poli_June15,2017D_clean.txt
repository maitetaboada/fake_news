Although so-called ‚Äoeprogressives‚Äù have been desperately trying to spin yesterday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s horrors, in which a crazed liberal opened fire on Republicans, it seems that not everyone is so keen on the idea. In fact, GOP lawmakers recently came forward to make quite the startling admission ‚Ä" and it has liberals panicking as it comes just one day after the shooting. On Wednesday, a horrible incident left 5 people in the hospital after a gunman opened fire on a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, while the field was occupied by members of Congress as they practiced for an upcoming charity baseball game. While most Americans were heartbroken to hear what a single gunman did, a few extreme leftists decided to use the pain and suffering of other people to further the liberal agenda. As a result, we saw a flurry of ‚ÄoeRepublicans deserved this‚Äù and ‚ÄoeTrump should have been the one that was shot‚Äù comments. However, the worst came as Democrats actually suggested that this was a reason to strip Americans of their Second Amendment rights. Despite the fact that the gunman was a flaming liberal himself, who was neutralized with a gun, it hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stopped his fellow liberals in their anti-gun pursuits. Unfortunately for them, they just got shot down as GOP lawmakers made a startling admission just one day after the shooting. According to The Daily Caller, ‚ÄoeTexas Republican Rep. Roger Williams, a player on his party‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s congressional baseball team, agreed with his colleagues saying that members having firearms would have been better for them when a gunman shot at the team Wednesday morning.‚Äù ‚ÄoeWell it took the second shot for me to understand what was happening here,‚Äù Williams explained. ‚ÄoeEverybody‚Ä¶ we were sitting ducks. I mean we had no‚Ä¶ we had nothing to fight back with but bats if it got to that. We were sitting ducks. I think he was not able to get on the field because the gate was locked on the other side. If [he had] gotten on the field it could have been a bad situation. But he was not able to do that. But we were sitting ducks.‚Äù He even went so far as to offer a solution that would allow for such a scenario to be an impossibility from here on out. When asked if he thinks members should be able to carry firearms in the Capitol and other currently restricted places, well, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll give you one guess on what he said. ‚ÄoeRemember two things,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄoeWell, first of all, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m for the Second Amendment ‚Ä" a big second amendment guy and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m from Texas. So yes, I would have felt a lot more comfortable if we were able to do that.‚Äù No matter how hard the left tries to spin everything, this case is a gleaming example why Americans are safer with guns. Criminals like this madman will always find a way to get their hands on guns ‚Ä" period. That includes breaking the law, which is exactly what this madman did. If these would-be killers don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mind the possibility of committing murder, which is already a crime, why would they mind committing another crime to get a gun to do it? When gun laws are passed, they only affect the people who actually follow the rules (i.e. law-abiding citizens). In the end, it was a good guy with the gun ‚Ä" who everyone was lucky was there ‚Ä" who put down this crazed attempted murderer. Just imagine if everyone would have been armed. My guess is, there would have been far fewer people shot and this guy wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have been able to get off 5 rounds let alone the 50 that he did.
