During a protest at Berkeley a month ago, an Antifa college professor got away with brutally beating a peaceful Donald Trump supporter with a bike lock, leaving him with a gruesome gash in his head. However, as soon as he thought he was untouchable, the smug educator received a satisfying dose of karma when he answered a knock at his door. After footage and photos surfaced of an ironically-titled anti-fascist protester who had bashed the head of a conservative demonstrator with a metal bike lock, the internet was indignant that the cowardly thug got away thanks to his balaclava. Fortunately, right-wing activists weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t about to let the leftist bigot terrorize conservatives without a fight. In an incredible display of technological prowess, 4Chan users worked together to correctly identify the masked fascist as none other than Diablo Valley College philosophy professor Eric Clanton. Despite pinpointing the identity beyond a shadow of a doubt, authorities didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t arrest Clanton. However, after pressure from the internet and conservative media, investigators finally looked into the case. Over a month later, Clanton received a knock on the door at a location in Oakland on Thursday, finally being placed in handcuffs and charged by local police for the attack ‚Ä" but karma didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop there. Berkeleyside reports that not only was Clanton charged with assault with a non-firearm deadly weapon, a charge of infliction of great bodily harm was also added. The ‚Äoenon-firearm deadly weapon‚Äù in question was confirmed as being a bike lock, which is the same object the Antifa criminal used in the April 15 attack. Authorities searched his home before tracking down Clanton at another location. Hilariously, Clanton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s job description claims he focuses on ‚Äoehis work in political philosophy‚Äù and ‚Äoemass incarceration and the prison systems.‚Äù Now, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be able to submerse himself in his studies, hopefully for a lengthy period of time. Along with his initial victim, Sean Stiles, police are expecting several more victims to come forward to press charges after a video surfaced of at least 2 others receiving injuries inflicted by Clanton. All 3 were reportedly beaten in the head and neck with the same bike lock. ‚ÄoeWe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re taking every case seriously,‚Äù Spiller said. ‚ÄoeWe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re still asking people to come forward that have information.‚Ä¶ There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s still work to be done.‚Äù BPD has asked the public to share photographs and videos ‚Äoeof those who may have committed crimes during the event,‚Äù and to share information by phone at 510-981-5818. Clanton is being held at Berkeley Jail with a $200,000 bond. His arraignment is scheduled for Friday at Oakland‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Wiley W. Manuel courthouse at 9 a.m., according to the East Bay Times. Although the attack was particularly horrific, it gained virtually no mainstream media attention. Instead, smaller conservative outlets reported the evidence, leading the cry for justice against the left-wing criminal. Perhaps the local police were simply waiting for the school year to end, giving Clanton time to finish indoctrinating students with his liberal agenda. Diablo Valley College President Ted Weiden has remained silent on the issue, refusing to respond to months-long calls for Clanton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s termination. Of course, not much is expected from Weiden, as he is more concerned with pacifying liberal snowflakes on his campus than cracking down on fascist lawbreakers who endanger the whole community. In November 2016, Weiden supported the bias proposal for an anti-free speech ‚Äoesafe space‚Äù for students who felt upset by Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s election. Weiden told the crowd that ‚Äoewe can have different opinions and disagree, but we can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be disagreeable with each other,‚Äù as his students and at least one professor terrorize and brutalize those who have ‚Äoedifferent opinions and disagree.‚Äù In fact, simply wearing a shirt or hat in support of Trump was enough to prompt these bigots to demand segregation, exclusion, and retaliation against conservatives. Ironically, Clanton and his Antifa comrades allegedly arrived at the protest to combat ‚Äoewhite supremacist views.‚Äù Instead, he and his fellow liberals proved that they are the true supremacists, violently retaliating against anyone for disagreeing with them. While declaring their ‚Äoeanti-fascist‚Äù beliefs, the leftists exacted fascist tactics to obliterate any freedom of expression.
