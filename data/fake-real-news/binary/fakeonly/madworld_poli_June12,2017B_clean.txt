While the mainstream media bashes President Donald Trump 24/7, many of the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s private moments are never known, like what he did at Kristen Piatkowski and Tucker Gladhill‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wedding, which was not suppose to get any press after Trump told the media losers to ‚Äoeget lost.‚Äù Luckily, wedding goers shared what the president did after he ditched the liberal media, and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got the video, along with the story, which is going to blow you away. Kristen Piatkowski and Tucker Gladhill got a big surprise at their wedding ‚Ä" the President of the United States. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right, Donald Trump heard the revelers at his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort at about 10:30 pm, and he immediately told the mainstream media to go away. CNN got their information after the event, reporting, ‚ÄoeGuests were unaware that Trump, who stayed at the club this weekend, was stopping by until Secret Service agents came into the room minutes before his arrival to clear the way and make sure guests wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t surround him, the source said.‚Äù Trump, who had to be extremely tired after a long day, decided he would be a normal wedding crasher, popping his head in to see a new couple starting out in life in the country he wants to make great again, and the couple got the shock of their lives as the crowd chanted, ‚ÄoeUSA, USA, USA!‚Äù Trump made surprise stop at wedding reception last night at Bedminster. The crowd broke out into chants of "USA!" (Video obtained by CNN) ‚Ä" Ashley Killough () June 11, 2017 You can see the CNN reporter in the above tweet says, ‚ÄoeVideo obtained by CNN,‚Äù that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s because Trump told the liberal jackals to go pound sand and leave the resort. Isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t this the exact reason we love our president? That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what wedding guests were saying after Trump left, and they reported, ‚ÄoeOnce he was there, Trump asked the names of the bride and groom and posed for photos. The source [told CNN] the President also signed some ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Make America Great Again‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> hats and gave them to guests.‚Äù The White House has been largely silent about the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s weekend activities in Bedminster. Members of the traveling press corps, which did not have access to the club, learned of the wedding visit when images started to appear on social media. Trump crashes wedding at his NJ golf club this weekend. ‚Ä" Caitlin Yilek () June 11, 2017 Trump was to headline a private fundraiser at the club Sunday night for Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-New Jersey, before returning to Washington, D.C., Sunday night. MacArthur found himself at the crux of the health care debate this spring when he proposed an amendment to the GOP health care plan that got enough conservatives on board to pass the measure. President Trump just gave those newlyweds some awesome memories that they will no doubt share with their grandchildren some day. The fact that Trump dismissed the press before he made his appearance proves he is not out to gain kudos from anyone. He acted out of kindness, and it shows us that he is a truly generous man and not the monster the liberals make him out to be. Sure, this was no big deal, but we know this is not something Hillary Clinton would ever do, and maybe that personal touch, that Trump is so good at, will win him re-election in 2020. Until then, we look forward to a bright future, backing a strong and compassionate man, who is draining the swamp and telling the mainstream media to get lost. You have to love President Trump, the ultimate wedding crasher.
