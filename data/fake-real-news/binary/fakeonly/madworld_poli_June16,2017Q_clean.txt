When Kayla Hart visited her local Starbucks in Charlotte, North Carolina, she had no idea her t-shirt would prompt the most regrettable of experiences. The young blonde was proudly wearing a ‚ÄoeMake America Great Again‚Äù shirt, and when employees at the coffee giant caught a glimpse of it, they served up a nasty surprise with her drink. According to Todd Starnes, when Kayla walked into the Starbucks on East Boulevard in the Dilworth neighborhood, the barista instantly took notice of her Donald Trump shirt. After the cashier laughed in her face, she was handed a drink labeled ‚ÄoeBuild A Wall‚Äù instead of with her name, mocking the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s plan to secure our porous Southern border with Mexico. ‚ÄoeThey shouted out, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Build a Wall‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and shoved a drink at me and then all the baristas in the back started cracking up laughing,‚Äù Kayla told FOX46. ‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what politics has to do with getting a cup of coffee. I just walked out because everyone was staring. I just found it really sad that I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wear a t-shirt supporting our president without being made fun of. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right; you should (not) be humiliated for wearing a t-shirt with your opinion on it.‚Äù Sadly, the only opinion which seems to be grounds for intimidation or humiliation these days is support for Donald Trump. If Hart had been wearing a shirt emblazoned with Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign slogan, ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m With Her,‚Äù you can bet the employees at Starbucks would have left her alone. Or, perhaps her coffee order would have been met with a thumbs up and a smile instead of public mockery. ‚ÄoeWe failed to meet this customer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s expectations of us, and we have apologized and are working directly with her to make it right,‚Äù Starbucks said in a statement. ‚ÄoeThis experience is not consistent with our standards or the welcoming and respectful experience we aim to provide every customer who visit our stores. We have spoken with our store partners about this situation and are using this as a coaching opportunity for the future.‚Äù Starbucks may have issued a half-assed apology, but this certainly isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the first time the coffeehouse has allowed their far-left views to get the best of them. If it were, we might be able to take their words more seriously. However, a genuine apology comes with a promise not to repeat the same offensive behavior, and we all know it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only a matter of time before an incident of this nature unfolds again at Starbucks, where your cup of Joe comes with a side of liberal agenda.
