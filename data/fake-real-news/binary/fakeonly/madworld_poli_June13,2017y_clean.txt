Shocking developments are coming out of the White House after President Donald Trump found the smoking gun that Barack Obama left at the White House. It was overlooked until recent events proved that this device was used for undermining Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be shocked that the mainstream media refuses to report on evidence that places Obama squarely in the middle of all the conspiracy theories meant to take out Trump. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. The liberal media has been on fire with accusations of Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign having colluded with the Russian government to undermine the election. After ten months of investigating these claims, no evidence has ever been found, yet they continue to beat that drum in the press. Now, according to Daily Caller, it was Barack Obama who had the ‚Äoeback channels‚Äù to the Kremlin and Iran right there in the Oval Office. How do we know? Because he left the ‚Äoedevice‚Äù behind, what is called the ‚Äoered phone,‚Äù not realizing it was easily linked and traced back to him. ‚ÄoeThe Obama administration had a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>back channel‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> to communicate with Russian officials, according to a new report detailing Moscow‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s efforts to delegitimize the U.S. presidential election results. The White House contacted the Kremlin on what Bloomberg described as a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>modern-day red phone,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>‚Äù reports Daily Caller. The ‚Äoered phone‚Äù wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t literally a phone, but a secure messaging channel for ‚Äoeurgent messages and documents,‚Äù according to Bloomberg. That secure messaging channel was still there when Trump moved into the Oval Office, and what it tells us is that, besides Russia, Obama used it to talk secretly with Iran to get the disastrous Iranian Nuke Deal done. Wow!just saw you on Fox;Mueller should be dismissed;Lynch should be charged & tried.We might also infer Obama colluded with Russians in 2012 ‚Ä" Fred P Chaney () June 13, 2017 Sharyl Attkisson, an award-winning journalist who left CBS after they refused to allow her to expose the Obama administration‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s many crimes, recently reported on Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s use of the red phone, saying that the ‚ÄoeObama administration approved months of secret meetings via ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>back channels‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> [red phone] between U.S. and Iranian officials to clinch an interim 2013 nuclear deal.‚Äù Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the irony, what is it that the Democrats and the mainstream media are accusing Donald Trump and his administration of? Colluding with the Russians, saying the evidence is Jared Kushner‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s use of back channels to speak to foreign governments like Russia. But, wait a minute, isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t this exactly what Obama did? Not only that, but Obama was caught colluding with Russia in many ways. On March 26, 2012, Obama was caught on that hot mic as Sharyl Attkisson reports: There is no evidence of Trump ever colluding with Russia, but there is evidence that Obama did. Trump has the smoking gun device known as the red phone, the secure channel that Obama used to send his secret messages to Iran and Russia. Isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t it rich that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Obama, now caught between a rock and a hard place? If his Democratic Party doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t back off of Trump, there is no doubt Trump will bring Obama down. These swamp creatures in Washington, D.C., are freaking out with this latest information. We know this because the mainstream media refuses to report on any of this, and if they did, it would mean they would lose everything. The Democrats are ‚Äoeall in‚Äù on taking Trump out, and when they can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t deliver, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s curtains for them in re-elections. Thus, Trump gets them to drain their own swamp, and I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think of a happier thought for all patriots across America than the trash taking itself out.
