An incredible video is circulating on social media after California Representative Maxine Waters swung by the #MarchForTruth protest in Los Angeles. However, she never expected that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d literally have to run away from two reporters who she agreed to pose with ‚Ä" and even viewers were left shocked to see what else was in the shot at the time. It all started when two citizen reporters, who go by the name Fleccas, decided to tape a wireless microphone to a wooden spoon and travel to the California protests against President Donald Trump. Wanting to point out the obvious bias, it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hard as the two interviewed quite a few leftists, who clearly didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what they were saying, before posting the video to YouTube. In the end, all the interview turned up is exactly what those of us on the right already know ‚Ä" liberals are mindless drones. With participants of the so-called ‚Äoeprotest‚Äù being oblivious to the truth, intentionally spreading falsehoods, and even admitting the fact that they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know why they were protesting, well, let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just say they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not concerned with facts. However, the interview would eventually take a turn as the two got up close and personal with none other than Maxine Waters. Pretending to be just another few people in the crowd, Fleccas cozied up to her, claiming to be reporters ‚Äoeprotesting the ties to Russia,‚Äù The American Mirror reports. Initially, Maxine had no problem posing with the two, but that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s when they sprang their trap. Without warning, one of the two blurted out, ‚ÄoeMaxine, what about your retirement fund ties to Russia ‚Ä" $200,000?‚Äù Unbeknownst to Ms. Waters, she was posing with two Trump supporters. Clearly caught between a rock and a hard place, Waters did her best to squirm her way out by saying, ‚ÄoeThat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a lie,‚Äù and literally running away like the coward she is. Come to find out, it seems that the only people with ties to Russia are Democrats: California Democrat Representative Maxine Waters held $200,000 in Russia-linked retirement accounts in 2015, even while she hypocritically calls for President Donald J. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s impeachment over his financial connections to Russia, according to her most recently available House of Representatives disclosure documents. ‚Ä¶ Waters‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 2015 disclosure statement details her family‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s investments in BlackRock‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Russia-connected Global Allocation and Balanced funds. [Source: GotNews] Of course, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enough to explain why she was so desperate to get out of there in the first place. Then again, when you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been banging the drum for impeachment by crying Russian involvement only for the American people to learn that you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re the one with ties to the communist country, what other choice do you have than to run away? The Democratic Party consists of perhaps the most corrupt members of society. Too bad for them, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not the smartest, which means there is plenty of breadcrumbs to follow. In the end, all they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re doing is digging their own graves because there is virtually no evidence pertaining to what they suggest. On the other hand, their own past is enough to bury them. Even worse yet, it looks like Waters may just be her own undoing ‚Ä" and it couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t happen to a more pathetic and despicable person.
