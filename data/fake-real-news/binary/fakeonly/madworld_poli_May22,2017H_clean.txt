Sniveling freeloaders everywhere are furious after what President Donald Trump just did to them. As it turns out, they shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have been so obsessed with all the fake scandals that the media is constantly spewing since Trump was able to dish out a nasty surprise that they never saw coming while they were distracted. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no arguing that so-called ‚Äoeentitlements‚Äù in this country are out of control. Of course, the left likes to use it as an indirect way of paying for votes as they guarantee that a larger portion of the country is dependent on the government to keep that money coming, thereby ensuring they continue to vote Democrat. However, there is one form of government assistance that seems to be taken advantage of more than others ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s food stamps. Although fraud is rife throughout all entitlement programs, EBT abusers have found a way to take advantage of the cash that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s intended for something they supposedly need by selling their food stamps to regular people at half the price. This means that non-food stamp recipients get their groceries at half the cost, and the EBT users get cash in their pocket. This happens in every single state, and officials have yet to eliminate the criminal practice, but that might all be about to change. Unfortunately for the idiots out there dumb enough to commit this type of fraud, Trump has officially stepped in to put the hurt on food stamp abusers everywhere. Although you hear about all the ‚Äoeillegal things‚Äù the president does, even though there is no proof to back any such claims, the media is dead silent on what he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s actually doing to make improvements, just like this recent one. Come to find out, Trump most recently brought the gravy train to a grinding halt for freeloaders everywhere by proposing a budget that would cut food stamp funding by 25 percent: The cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program comes as part of a wider so-called welfare reform initiative worth $274 billion over the next decade. Cuts to food stamps would be significantly larger than any previously attempted by House Republicans, amounting to $193 billion, and would achieve that goal through limited eligibility criteria and conditional work requirements. Around 42 million Americans are currently on the program. [Source: The Daily Dot] The Washington Post reports that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not all, as Medicaid would see $800 billion in funding cuts over the decade as well. If we know anything about the government, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s that they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mind spending money. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re $20 trillion in debt. Of course, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s always easier to spend other people‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s money than your own ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly why America voted Trump in. Not only are we sick of having our taxes raised and more of our money stolen out of our pockets, we have virtually no control over how it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s spent. Fortunately, with new leadership, it looks like we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to get to keep more of what we earn. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know about you, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sick of someone stealing my money to give it to someone else too lazy to earn their own. America is finally making a comeback ‚Ä" and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a beautiful thing. Sadly, the leftist media is once again trying to paint this as a bad thing by saying that Trump is taking away from people who need it. As we all know, though, this isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t always the case. Now, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s up to social services to better regulate how easily they give away money. After all, if you really want the true people in need to get this cash, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to take some effort. Even better yet, that means that those wishing to take advantage of the system will naturally be weeded out of the equation. In the end, only one thing is true ‚Ä" if you want money, you better get off your lazy butt and go earn it.
