The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is not having a good day as he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s still dealing with the most recent act of terror that caused tragedy and chaos in his city. Unfortunately for him, things just got a lot worse after the public learned what he did just two days before the attack that essentially helped it happen ‚Ä" and now, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s screwed. As most of the world is aware, 3 jihadis were responsible for killing 7 innocent victims and injuring another 21 after plowing their truck through a crowd of people in London before getting out and stabbing people with knives. However, the response from officials isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exactly what most people would expect after 3 attacks in England over just a few short months. Rather than deal with the threat accordingly and start to fix the situation, liberal politicians like the Muslim Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, have come forward to tell people to ‚Äoeremain calm‚Äù while saying there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoeno reason to be alarmed.‚Äù Of course, in the same breath, Khan even went on to say that the threat of another terror attack remains high. Although liberals didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like it, President Donald Trump was quick to bash Khan on Twitter. Mentioning those killed and injured, Trump then suggested that there was plenty to worry about. At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!" ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 4, 2017 Unfortunately, Khan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s recent words are only making matters worse after people learned what he was doing two days prior that essentially helped the terrorists carry out their attack. According to The Blaze, Khan was informally lashing out at Trump by focusing on current ‚Äoerisks of humanity.‚Äù Climate change remains one the biggest risks to humanity. Now more than ever world leaders must recognise and act on this threat. ‚Ä" Mayor of London () June 1, 2017 Of course, he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t focused on Islamic terror but rather climate change. Now, because he failed to focus on the very real threat that is before him, 7 members of his city are dead with more injured. Making matters worse, Mail Online reports that ISIS warned the world that more attacks were ‚Äoedefinitely coming,‚Äù but Khan chose to ignore that and lecture Trump and the world on climate change. In a gut-churning series of events, Khan then went on to say that the London terror attacks had ‚Äoenothing to do with Islam.‚Äù One can only imagine how frustrated Englanders must feel to hear that every time a Muslim kills innocent people on the streets in the name of Islam. Sadiq Khan: This sickening act has nothing to do with the Islam I know ‚Ä" Evening Standard () June 5, 2017 The sad thing is, there is a very real solution here that the left continually refuses to see ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s acknowledging the problem for what it is. How many times have those of us on the right heard something about the KKK when talking about Islam? For some reason, liberals seem to think that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s relevant or even comparable, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not: After all, look at everything that Christians did to shut the KKK down. We outlawed them. All of Christianity condemned their actions every time, and no one made excuses. Unfortunately, you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see that when it comes to Islamic terror. The left simply says, ‚ÄoeThey don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t represent Islam,‚Äù but they do. The entire Quran is fixated on world domination and Sharia law. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time people get real about it because this is only going to continue happening the longer the problem goes unaddressed. In fact, the longer Khan continues to make excuses for such behavior, the more he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s screwing himself when it comes to the next election cycle. Lying about it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help anyone, and at this point, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only getting people killed.
