Crooked Hillary Clinton has no conscience. She proved this during her time as Secretary of State. Now, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s gone the extra mile and removed all doubt that she has no memory either. In a speech that reminds us of the laughable Maxine Waters (D-CA), Hillary recently pushed President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s impeachment while forgetting one huge detail that takes idiocy to a whole new level. According to Daily Mail, Hillary Clinton gave a disturbing graduation speech at Wellesley College in Massachusetts on Friday, May 26, 2017, during which she invoked the impeachment of President Donald Trump. As she rolled out the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tired narrative of ‚Äoeobstruction of justice,‚Äù Hillary suggested Trump will be impeached by using former President Richard Nixon as an example. Speaking to a mostly liberal class of cheering graduates, Hillary made it clear that she was pedaling Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s impeachment. In typical progressive style, she tried to use her ideas about the steps to authoritarianism to stir up fear in her snowflake audience. ‚ÄoeWe were furious about the past presidential election of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice,‚Äù Hillary Clinton said. Next, in what she thought was a clever move, Hillary alluded to Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s firing of the corrupt former FBI Director James Comey by citing Nixon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s firing of the head of the Department of Justice as her irrational tirade provoked cheers from the ignorant graduates. Hillary continued building her case for Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s impeachment by pointing out how ‚Äoeauthoritarian‚Äù regimes evolve by citing Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disregard for the liberal mainstream media. ‚ÄoeWhen people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄoeThat is not hyperbole, it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done,‚Äù she added. Hillary‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s proclivity for hypocrisy knows no bounds. How could she possibly accuse Trump of manufacturing his own facts when she is the one who screwed millions of Democrat voters in the primary and habitually lied about her illegal email server while putting our national security at risk? That isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the worst of it. ‚ÄoeYou are graduating at a time when there is a full-fledged assault on truth and reason,‚Äù she said to the graduates. The level of idiocy coming from Hillary Clinton is almost unbearable. The one huge thing she forgot as she stood on stage spewing her moronic ideas is that her own husband, former President Bill Clinton, was impeached. If ever there was a time when America witnessed a ‚Äoefull-fledged assault on truth and reason,‚Äù it was during her husband‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presidency and Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presidency. Hillary‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mind has gone where her conscience went ‚Ä" into oblivion. When Trump famously told the media that he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to go after the Clintons for their corrupt foundation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dealings or Hillary‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s illegal email server, it stunned millions of American patriots. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s very clear he was trying to be a gracious winner. That ship has sailed, and now, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to unleash the full power of the Department of Justice on the Clinton Klan. Many, like myself, want to know when enough will be enough. What is the breaking point where we will finally see crooked Hillary and her family prosecuted for arrogantly trampling our laws? Hopefully, soon.
