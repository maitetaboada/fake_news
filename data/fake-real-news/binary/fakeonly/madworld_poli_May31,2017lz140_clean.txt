After liberal comedienne Kathy Griffin posed for photos of herself holding a ‚Äoedecapitated‚Äù Donald Trump effigy soaked in blood, she defended her statement, calling it ‚Äoeart.‚Äù However, Griffin was immediately silenced when a U.S. intelligence asset who served in the Iraq War cut her down to size by requesting that she do one small favor for him. Despite claiming their social justice slogan ‚ÄoeLove Trumps Hate,‚Äù leftists are the most intolerant toward anyone holding a different view. Of course, none is as lauded for displaying this bigotry as the Hollywood elitists who use their entitlement to spout rants invoking hatred and violence against their opposition before scurrying up their ivory towers to safety. Unfortunately for washed-up comic Kathy Griffin, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no ladder tall enough to escape the mortification she must be feeling after a serviceman gave his commentary on her macabre political stunt. When the expressionless Griffin held up a fake President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s severed head, she said she ‚Äoewasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t afraid to make noise.‚Äù Apparently, she never expected that her ‚Äoenoise‚Äù would catch the ear of Hamody Jasim, a former intelligence asset to the U.S. government during Operation Iraqi Freedom. In an exclusive interview with Independent Journal Review, Jasim gave him thoughts on Griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoeart‚Äù project, putting the aging celebrity in her place like only a service member can. Having personally tended to the corpses of beheading victims and their traumatized family members in Iraq, Jasim first called out Griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disrespect and hypocrisy before extending to her a chance to atone for her repulsive display. After rightfully criticizing the comic, Jasim offered to personally escort Griffin to Iraq so she can perform her art expose for the families whose loved ones were beheaded. ‚ÄoeI lost a cousin to ISIS. They tied his hands behind his back and shot him in the head. I lost a nephew and friends to ISIS. I lost people who I fought with in the Iraq War to ISIS. They were hunted down and slaughtered. ISIS killed people in an ice cream shop in Baghdad Monday. They will continue to murder innocent people as long as possible. Look, this is not a funny thing. This b**** crossed a red line with what she did. ‚ÄoeI would love to take her to Iraq and introduce her to family members whose loved ones were beheaded. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d challenge her to perform her vile act in front of them. See how they feel. See how they react. Then we can go to the refugee camps where the children don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have parents because ISIS beheaded or murdered them. Perform for them, too,‚Äù Jasim said. Although Jasim brilliantly exposed Griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hypocrisy, he pointed out an aspect of the grotesque performance that most missed. Pulling no punches, Jasim equated Griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s photo session to ISIS-style propaganda films and accused her of an underlying message of encouragement to assassinate Trump. ‚ÄoeGriffin holding up a Donald Trump head covered in blood is no different than when ISIS puts out videos of its young recruits slitting the throat[s] on dolls. She isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t speaking a language of comedy. Whether she knows it or not, she is speaking the language of terrorism. Her decision to do the photo shoot and share it is benefiting ISIS. She is making light of something that is killing people all the time,‚Äù said Jasim. Jasim reiterated that his offer still stands, although he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expect Griffin to ever muster up enough decency to respond to him. He added that he believes Griffin should give another apology, this time to the victims of terrorism, many of whom lost their loved ones to beheaders like the one she mockingly portrayed. ‚ÄoeThe photographer who did the shoot should be ashamed of himself,‚Äù Jasim added. ‚ÄoeGriffin should remove the photo and issue an apology to every victim of terrorism. I await her response to my invitation to accompany her to Iraq.‚Äù Griffin issued a seemingly scripted apology to do some damage control only after suffering a backlash from shocked and outraged viewers which resulted in her losing an endorsement deal with Squatty Potty and possibly forfeiting her CNN NYE coverage gig. The left preaches tolerance and love for all while cutting down their enemies by any means necessary. On the bright side, Griffin has finally rediscovered her ability to mock the President of the United States after an 8-year hiatus. Unfortunately, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s still just as distastefully unfunny now as she was then.
