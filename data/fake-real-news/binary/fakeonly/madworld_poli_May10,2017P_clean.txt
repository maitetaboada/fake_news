In a move that was long overdue, President Donald Trump abruptly fired former FBI Director James Comey. The moment that the termination letter made its way to the Internet, it didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take long for one man to discover a hidden message, and the two words truly put the corrupt Comey in line. Upon taking a look at President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s letter to former FBI Director James Comey, Stefan Molyneux, the host of Freedomain Radio, was able to spot what seemed to be a hidden message embedded within the letter. Of course, understanding the broken relationship between the two men, Molyneux posted 2-word phrase on his Twitter account. The secret code lies within the first two paragraphs. Placed carefully on the left side of each line, where the sentence structure simply comes together to form the 2-word humiliation to finally put Comey in his place: ‚ÄoeI Win.‚Äù I cracked the code! ‚Ä" Stefan Molyneux () May 10, 2017 Ouch! Not only did James Comey just get fired for his inability to do his job, but he publicly got put in his place by the President of the United States, even though the message was likely unintentional. Clearly, Trump and Comey didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get along ‚Ä" and for good reason. Considering Comey has been overseeing the FBI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s investigation into the Trump campaign‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s alleged ties to Russia, something that there is absolutely no evidence to support, as well as the ridiculous Hillary Clinton email fiasco and cover up, his termination has been a long time coming. Obviously, Trump has been waiting for the right moment to make his move, and now that it has happened, Comey only has himself to blame. Donald Trump is an intelligent man, even if the left would have you believe otherwise. There aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t too many people who can patiently wait for their enemy to screw up and literally sign their own termination papers. Well played, President Trump, well played.
