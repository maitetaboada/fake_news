An image is taking off across social media after President Donald Trump posed for a quick photo with two kids. However, it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t so much the people in the snapshot that got everyone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attention as it was what else the picture caught ‚Ä" and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s left many viewers downright shocked. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence attended a memorial for fallen officers at the U.S. Capitol. Now, just a few days later, a photo from the event is going viral ‚Ä" and there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s actually a really good reason for it. Trump posed with Elijah and Gianna Lucas while in Washington, D.C., for a ceremony on National Peace Officers‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Memorial Day. According to The Fresno Bee, the duo‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father is just one of the ‚Äoe118 officers who died in the line of duty [in 2016].‚Äù Lucas died an accidental death at the hands of one of his law enforcement colleagues on October 31, 2016. They were shifting guns around, talking about different ways to carry a second gun, when a gun was accidentally discharged, and a bullet struck Lucas in the chest. Investigators determined no foul play was involved. Rather, Lucas, a 20-year-veteran of the force, was ‚Äoehaving a conversation with a nine-year veteran detective about the various ways to carry backup weapons when the shot was fired.‚Äù [Source: Breitbart] Now, the image of the three is taking off all because of what else it captured. As can be seen, Trump is actually holding the identification card of Elijah and Gianna‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father, fallen Fresno County Sheriff‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Deputy Sergeant Rod Lucas. But, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not all the picture managed to capture. Clearly depicted in the image is a genuine joy on the faces of those in the photo as Trump stopped to personally tell them that their dad was a hero who is appreciated for his service. Now, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know about you, but I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t remember even one time that former President Barack Obama gave recognition of any kind to a fallen officer or their family. In fact, when 5 officers were gunned down in Dallas, Texas, by members of the Black Lives Matter movement, he did his best to dance around the matter. When you can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t say that a thug who gunned down an innocent person is a bad man, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a problem. Furthermore, when you can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t thank a police officer who died in the line of duty for their service, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s an even greater issue at hand. With that being said, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really no wonder why the reaction to this image has been so great as we finally have a leader at the helm again. Our nation used to be one of solidarity until the destructor-in-chief, Barack Obama, had a full 8 years to have his way with our country. Now, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re seeing the results, but light is on the horizon as law and order is being restored. As for these kids, well, they deserve to know that their father was a hero, and there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no one better to make that perfectly clear than the President of the United States himself.
