With the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Russian collusion‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> case against the Trump administration all but dead, the mainstream media has shifted their full attention to now building an obstruction of justice case against the White House. As such, CNN hosted Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel appointed in the 90‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s to look into various Clinton scandals, including the Vince Foster death and Monica Lewinsky episode, this morning to get his thoughts on the topic. Of course, the incredulous CNN anchor was simply unwilling to accept that Trump may be innocent of high crimes and pressed further by asking whether Comey would have had to ‚Äoeobey‚Äù Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s suggestion to drop the Flynn investigation in order to be guilty of obstruction. And, while CNN aired the most ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>convenient‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 10 seconds of Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s testimony, they failed to mention the following interaction from earlier in which Comey confirmed under oath that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d never been asked to end an investigation for political purposes. He also said that any efforts to do so would be a ‚Äoebig deal.‚Äù Therefore, to Ken Starr‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s point, if Comey interpreted Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s comment on Flynn as a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>directive‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> then shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t that have qualified as ‚Äoea big deal‚Äù that he should have elevated immediately?
