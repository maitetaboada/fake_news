US Capitol Police are actively investigating three Muslim brothers who were caught spying and stealing classified information while working within the House of Representatives. As the hearing into the case wore on, Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz recently freaked out, shocking the police chief with a threat. Debbie is scurrying like a rat, trying to shut down this vital investigation for one reason that Americans deserve to know. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is hiding something, and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s freaking out as she tries to shut down the investigation into the Awan brothers. Right now, the US Capitol Police Department is focusing on Irwin Awan, who has run technology for the Florida lawmaker since 2005 and was banned from the House network in February on suspicion of data breaches and theft of classified information. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d think Wasserman Schultz would want an investigation into alleged spies, but no, after learning that the police could not promise to return her ‚Äoeequipment,‚Äù basically her laptops and desk computers, she used that as a reason to refuse to turn them over, and she even threatened the police chief. When Police Chief Matthew R. Verderosa told the Florida Democrat, ‚ÄoeWe can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t return the equipment,‚Äù Wasserman Schultz responded with what can only be taken as a threat. ‚ÄoeI think you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re violating the rules when you conduct your business that way and you should expect that there will be consequences,‚Äù she said. In a highly unusual exchange, the Florida lawmaker uses a hearing on the Capitol Police‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s annual budget to spend three minutes repeatedly trying to extract a promise from the chief that he will return a piece of evidence being used to build an active case. ‚Ä¶ A federal employee with knowledge of the situation and who requested anonymity told The Daily Caller News Foundation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Investigative Group that as House authorities closed in on Imran Awan and his brothers, a laptop used by Imran was hidden in an unused crevice of the Rayburn House Office Building. Wasserman Schultz‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s office is in Longworth House Office Building, a separate structure. [Sourc: Daily Caller] The congresswoman characterizes the evidence as ‚Äoebelonging‚Äù to her and argues that it cannot, therefore, be seized unless Capitol Police tell her that she personally, as opposed to her staffer, is a target of the investigation. So, why the cloak and dagger by Wasserman Schultz? Well, one reason can be that it was Wasserman Schultz who was in charge of the Democratic National Committee when they were supposedly hacked by Russia. She was in charge back then, and her emails were part of the hack. So far, the DNC has failed to turn over any of their computers to the FBI, instead relying on a private firm to confirm whether they were hacked by Russia. Now, Wasserman Schultz is freaking out about the Capitol Police having possession of her device. There seems to be a problem with anyone involved with the DNC turning over any of their computers to law enforcement, yet, we are to just take them at their word that they were hacked by Russia. After Daily Caller asked why she wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want the Capitol Police to have any evidence that they may need to find and punish any hackers of government information, she abruptly turned around in the middle of a stairwell and retreated back to the office from which she had come. Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the real kicker, Wasserman Schultz rehired the alleged Muslim spy, Irwin Awan, after he was put under investigation by the Capitol Police. ‚ÄoeThough on the surface Wasserman Schultz would have been a victim of Awan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s scam, she has inexplicably protected him, circumventing the network ban by re-titling him as an ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>adviser‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> instead of technology administrator,‚Äù reports Daily Caller. Something very strange is going on with the Democrats. As various investigations go on into their bogus claims about President Donald Trump or with anything that has to do with hacking their computers, they are refusing to cooperate. It seems their house of cards is coming down, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sick that Wasserman Schultz will protect Muslim spies to save her own skin.
