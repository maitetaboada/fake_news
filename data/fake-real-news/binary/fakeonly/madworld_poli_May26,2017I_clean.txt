President Donald Trump is currently in the midst of his first overseas trip since taking office, and he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s showing all of the wimpy liberal leaders in Europe who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s boss. When France‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s new president Emmanuel Macron ignored his American counterpart during the NATO summit in Brussels this week, Trump only waited 15 seconds before making him look like a weak little schoolgirl. Video footage emerged on Thursday of a tense moment between Trump and Macron at the NATO summit in Brussels. In the clip, Macron is seen walking towards a group of world leaders, which included Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. According to The Huffington Post, the French president seemed to be making a beeline for Trump, whose hands were outstretched in apparent anticipation of a warm welcome, but just feet away, Macron swerved and embraced Merkel instead. Trump clearly did not appreciate the snub, and he let that be known about 15 seconds later, by nearly breaking Macron‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s arm off when they shook hands. Macron shared the video on his official Twitter account late Thursday. √Ä Bruxelles, unis avec nos alli√©s de . ‚Ä" Emmanuel Macron () May 25, 2017 MILO offered a particularly funny and on-point account of the heated exchange between Trump and Macron: Hilarious footage uploaded to Twitter shows President Donald Trump making a complete ass of French President Emmanuel Macron after the former apparently ignored his invitation for a hug in favor of embracing German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The clip shows Trump walking alongside several NATO leaders towards Macron, who sharply veers towards Merkel as Trump stands awkwardly with his hands outstretched. Trump would eventually get the upper hand, however; when Macron finally reached out to shake his hand, Trump made the man look like he had a noodle for an arm. The centrist French President also received a firm slap on the back. Macron‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s little stunt was doubly offensive because he did not choose just any world leader to embrace while ignoring Trump. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no secret that Trump and Merkel have butted heads on nearly every issue, and Merkel‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s visit to the U.S. after Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s inauguration wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exactly warm. There isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t much the two agree on when it comes to policy, but perhaps the most notable difference in political views between the two is on immigration. Merkel is largely to blame for allowing throngs of un-vetted Muslim migrants into her country, to the peril of her own people. Meanwhile, Trump has maintained a hardline stance on immigration, especially the taking in of so-called ‚Äoerefugees‚Äù from the Middle East. Not surprisingly, Merkel became one of former President Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s best foreign buddies while he was in office, as the pair saw eye to eye when it came to destroying one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own country in the interest of Muslims, many of whom seek to do Westerners harm. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exchange with Macron was not the only encounter of note to unfold on Thursday in Brussels; there was more than one Trump making mince meat of a Macron during the NATO summit. First Lady Melania also upstaged the French president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife, Brigitte, when the pair met while touring the Magritte Museum. Brigitte was simply no match for Melania‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s beauty and grace. Indeed, the Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s cannot be outdone, a fact which every world leader is currently coming to terms with.
