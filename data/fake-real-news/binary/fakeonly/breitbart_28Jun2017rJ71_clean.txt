On Wednesday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s broadcast of MSNBC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚ÄoeMorning Joe,‚Äù Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) argued that health insurance companies are pulling out of markets and raising rates because of the Trump administration. Murphy said, ‚Äoe[W]e‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been very clear that we would love nothing more than to sit down with Republicans and try to, you know, keep what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s working with the Affordable Care Act and fix the parts that aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. And, you know, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s an imperative to do that. Because insurance companies are pulling out of these markets, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re raising rates because of the instability that the Trump administration has injected into the markets by refusing to commit to continuing to pay insurers.‚Äù (h/t Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter
