The Venezuela Supreme Court is closely tied to the socialist leadership and attempted to install itself as the nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s legislature in March. The U.S. Treasury has sanctioned all eight members of the nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s court of last resort. Images on social media showed a helicopter belonging to the country‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Scientific, Penal, and Criminal Investigations Unit (CICPC) flying over the Supreme Court, waving a flag reading ‚Äoe350 Freedom.‚Äù The flag referred to Article 350 of the nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s constitution, which reads: ‚ÄoeThe people of Venezuela, loyal to their republican tradition, their struggle for independence, peace, and liberty, will not recognize any regime, legislation, or authority that defies the values, principles, and democratic guarantees or disregards human rights.‚Äù Momento en el que helic√≥ptero del CICPC dispar√≥ a sede del #TSJ en #Caracas. Report√≥ #27Jun ‚Ä" CaraotaDigital () June 28, 2017 Helic√≥ptero del Cicpc pidi√≥ libertad sobrevolando el TSJ (+Fotos) D ‚Ä" DolarToday¬Æ () June 28, 2017 The man visible flying the helicopter in question has been identified, according to Miami‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s El Nuevo Herald, as Oscar P√©rez, a police officer with the unit to which the helicopter belongs. In a bizarre development, videos began surfacing on an Instagram account believed to belong to P√©rez apparently showing him surrounded by masked fighters, condemning the Chavista regime. 1/5 Venezolanos Queridos Hermanos, Les hablamos en representaci√≥n del Estado; somos una coalici√≥n entre funcionarios militares, policiales y civiles, en b√∫squeda del equilibrio y en contra de este Gobierno transitorio y criminal. NO pertenecemos ni tenemos tendencia pol√≠tico-partidista; somos nacionalistas, patriotas e institucionalistas. Este combate no es con el resto de las fuerzas de seguridad de estado que permanecen en desacuerdo, es con la impunidad impuesta, si no en contra del gobierno nefasto. Contra la tiran√≠a, A post shared by OSCAR PEREZ () on Jun 27, 2017 at 3:27pm PDT In the first of five videos, the man identifies his group as ‚Äoea coalition among soldiers, policemen, and civilians seeking balance and opposing this transitory criminal government. We do not belong to any political party; we are nationalists, patriots, and institutionalists.‚Äù Univisi√≥n notes that, in his message following the incident, Maduro claims that P√©rez was once the pilot for Miguel Rodr√≠guez Torres, a former Venezuelan justice minister who has turned on the regime. Maduro‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s government has tied Rodr√≠guez Torres to the CIA and floated conspiracies linking him with Western pro-democracy interests. In his statement Tuesday night, Maduro made clear that he believed the helicopter incident was a ‚Äoeterrorist‚Äù attack conducted by an unnamed coalition of anti-socialist forces seeking to take down his government. ‚ÄoeBehind all of this is the plan, the activation of a generalized violence to make life impossible for Venezuelans,‚Äù he alleged, urging the public to vote in favor of his plan to draft a new constitution that would greatly expand executive power, ‚Äoeto gather up these terrorist groups.‚Äù Venezuela‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s state media outlet, VTV, claimed that the helicopter incident was ‚Äoefinanced by sectors of the opposition‚Äù and part of a greater ‚Äoecoup‚Äù attempt against him. Maduro has repeatedly accused the United States ‚Ä" and former vice president Joe Biden in particular ‚Ä" of organizing coup plots against him. Maduro announced that no known injuries had occurred as a result of the helicopter incident but noted that a social event was taking place at the Supreme Court at the time, which could have resulted in casualties should the helicopter have attacked. Shortly before reports began surfacing of the helicopter appearing over Caracas, a group of armed Chavista thugs known as colectivos stormed the headquarters of the National Assembly, the opposition-controlled federal legislative body. ‚ÄoeThe government supporters launched at least five explosive artifacts towards the interior of the legislative headquarters,‚Äù according to Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional. Opposition legislators were in the building at the time though none reported injuries. Prior to his statement on the helicopter, Maduro had asserted that he would resort to violence if his call to discard the constitution in his favor did not win at the polls. ‚ÄoeIf Venezuela was plunged into chaos and violence and the Bolivarian Revolution destroyed, we would go to combat. We would never give up, and what couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be done with votes, we would do with weapons, we would liberate the fatherland with weapons,‚Äù he threatened, according to Reuters. Maduro also accused President Donald Trump of being personally responsible for the violence in Venezuela: ‚ÄoeYou have the responsibility: stop the madness of the violent Venezuelan right wing.‚Äù President Trump has repeatedly condemned the Maduro regime and called for a restoration of the democratic order in the South American country.
