Hateful liberals didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait long before seizing the opportunity to come out with two sick wishes after a gunman opened fire on the Republican congressional baseball practice Wednesday morning in Alexandria, Virginia, wounding Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise and four others. Outrage has erupted all over social media at their complete lack of humanity. According to The Gateway Pundit, some opportunistic liberals on social media said that they wish it had been President Donald Trump who was shot instead of Congressman Scalise while others immediately pounced on the tragedy to call for more gun control. Too bad these sadistic progressives don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have Barack Obama to hide facts and puppet the media as details of what the gunman did before opening fire on the congressmen come to light. The Gateway Pundit reports that liberal James Bryant took to Twitter with a sick wish for our President. It didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take long before this despicable individual took down his Twitter page, but not before his comment was captured. Hopefully, James will be getting a visit from the Secret Service soon. I think his life could use a cavity search or two. The Governor of Virginia, Terry McCauliffe, said, ‚ÄoeI have long advocated, this is not what today is about, but there are too many guns on the street. We lose 93 million Americans a day to gun violence. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve long talked about this. Background checks, shutting down gun show loopholes. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not for today‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s discussion. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not just about politicians, we worry about this every day for all of our citizens.‚Äù Oddly enough, McCauliffe closed by saying, ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not going to get anywhere near the investigation, the FBI is looking into this.‚Äù According to Breitbart, McCauliffe gave an enormous campaign contribution to Andrew McCabe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife during the time of the FBI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s illegal server. Andrew McCabe was the assistant FBI Director at the time. He currently serves as the acting FBI Director until Trump replaces him. The Governor of Virginia has a bad track record when it comes to staying away from FBI investigations. In addition, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not quite sure where McCauliffe got 93 million dead Americans a day. Perhaps this was just wishful thinking on his part. McCauliffe later corrected his exaggerated figure after he was undoubtedly corrected by a cringing aid. These are just two examples of how liberals are behaving badly after such a tragic event. Our prayers go out to Scalise and his family as he is recovering from his gunshot wound.
