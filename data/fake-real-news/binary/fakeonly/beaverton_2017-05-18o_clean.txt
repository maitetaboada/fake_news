Every week Beaverton editor-in-chief Luke Gordon Field assembles some of the countryâ€<sup>TM</sup>s best comedians and writers to talk, mock and riff their way through the news of the week. Then he puts their knowledge to the test in a very important quiz where the winner gets absolutely nothing. Part panel show, part interview, the Beaverton Weekly Report is an hilarious look at whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s going on in the world around us. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll be just like watching CNN, only funnier and with fewer erectile dysfunction ads. Beaverton editor-in-chief Luke Gordon Field welcomes an all-star panel made up of stand-up comedian Andrew Ivimey, podcaster Jocelyn Geddie and television writer Jacob Duarte Spiel. Together they tackle the B.C. election (3:00), Kevin Oâ€<sup>TM</sup>Leary dropping out of the Conservative Leadership Race (6:00) What Andrew Scheer looks like (10:00), Why Quebec politics is basically The Wire (14:00), the Harjit Sajan scandal (17:00) and how no Party is more progressive than the Liberals in an election year (18:00). Then itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s time for the very first Approximately 10 Minute Long Quiz where the Panel puts their knowledge, skills and Canadian identity to the test.
