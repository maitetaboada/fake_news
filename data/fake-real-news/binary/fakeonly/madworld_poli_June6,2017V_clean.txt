Huma Abedin has stepped out for her first public appearance since filing for divorce from disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner in May. Unfortunately for Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s longtime BFF, though, one thing went horribly wrong. Abedin surfaced at the CFDA Fashion Awards, which left many people scratching their heads, as she has always been a staple in the political world but definitely not the world of fashion. According to PEOPLE, the 40-year-old mother, who was vice chair of Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 2016 presidential campaign, walked the carpet at the prestigious, star-studded fashion event wearing a long-sleeve, button-down, floor-length silk flowing gown featuring a gathered knot at its waist. Abedin accessorized the look with oversized gold earrings and a coordinating statement gold sapphire ring. She kept her long brown hair down, curly, and parted to the side, and her makeup simple, with a red lip and a touch of mascara. Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s former aide showed up solo on the red carpet at the CFDA Fashion Awards in New York dressed in a fuchsia gown. Abedin separated from her husband, disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, last August after he was caught in his third sexting scandal. She said she made the decision after ‚Äoelong and painful consideration and work on my marriage.‚Äù [Source: The Smoke Room] Abedin instantly became the butt of one joke in particular from those on social media who jested that she was out ‚Äoelooking for a new Weiner.‚Äù This was not the only embarrassing ‚ÄoeWeiner‚Äù joke to come Abedin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s way, either. Indeed, it seemed that no one had anything nice to say about Abedin, be it about the way she looked or her track record of scandals and corruption. ‚ÄoeLet‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s see now, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a Democrat and her husband is a creep. No wonder she doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to go out in public!!‚Äù commented one person on Facebook. ‚ÄoeShe looks like a worn out hooker,‚Äù wrote another. Others noted that she should be behind bars rather than out galavanting with celebrities on the red carpet at a fashion awards show. ‚ÄoeStripes would suit her well,‚Äù commented one Facebook user. ‚ÄoePerhaps soon she will be wearing stripes!‚Äù echoed another. Truth be told, Huma Abedin deserves every bit of ridicule tossed her way by Americans who are rightfully angry that she has seemingly been able to get away with murder as Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sidekick. Thank God, Hillary lost in November. Sure, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll have to deal with a couple public appearances by Abedin here and there, but at least she won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be in our White House!
