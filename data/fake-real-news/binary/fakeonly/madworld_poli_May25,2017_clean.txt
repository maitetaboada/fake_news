The mainstream media is hiding one of the most important stories in years. Thanks to two independent journalists, who uncovered secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) classified documents just filed at the end of April, we now know that the court found Barack Obama guilty of the one thing that totally vindicates President Donald Trump. Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the bombshell report that every American needs to know. This is the biggest story the mainstream media refuses to cover, and it starts with hardcore evidence of spying on Americans and ends with the Obama conspiracy to take out Donald Trump. According to Circa News, the National Security Agency under Barack Obama violated the privacy of Americans by spying on us. This was so widespread that 5% of all Americans were violated. ‚ÄoeMore than 5 percent or one out of every 20 searches seeking upstream Internet data on Americans inside the NSA‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s so-called Section 702 database violated the safeguards Obama and his intelligence chiefs vowed to follow in 2011,‚Äù reports Circa News. Then, two weeks before Donald Trump was elected president, Obama knew these violations would be found out by the incoming administration, so he instructed his lawyers at the DOJ to inform the FISA court and come clean. Thinking that this would all stay ‚Äoesecret,‚Äù Obama hoped that would be it. But, the big problem is he also spied on Donald Trump for no good reason. Rush Limbaugh weighed in, saying, ‚ÄoeDid you hear Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s CIA director, John Brennan, yesterday told a House committee that he was concerned that the Russians might be able to turn some of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s people ‚Ä" in other words, corrupt them ‚Ä" and convert them into spies for the Russian Federation. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why, Brennan said, the CIA and the NSA had to monitor them.‚Äù This bombshell admission by Brennan was also ignored by the mainstream media, which turns a blind eye to anything that exposes the truth. Brennan went on to testify that there was no evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a huge problem. To spy on an American citizen, there has to be a reason. Brennan admits they had none. But, remember, Obama admitted to the FISA court that he was spying on Americans illegally, so it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a no-brainer that Trump was targeted for political purposes. We all knew it, but now it can be proven, and that puts Obama and his minions in a very bad legal situation. #BREAKING CIA Director John Brennan's role in unmasking Americans identities in NSA intercepts | Circa News ‚Ä" Learn. ‚Ä" Sara A. Carter () May 23, 2017 Circa News uncovered how the FISA court found Obama guilty of violating Americans Fourth Amendment rights. They report, ‚ÄoeThe normally supportive court censured administration officials, saying the failure to disclose the extent of the violations earlier amounted to an ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>institutional lack of candor‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and that the improper searches constituted a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>very serious Fourth Amendment issue,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> according to a recently unsealed court document dated April 26, 2017.‚Äù So, the massive cover-up is coming out. Obama and his minions in the NSA, FBI, and CIA all admitted to the FISA court that they were illegally spying on Americans. Now, Brennan comes clean and admits, yes, they were spying on Trump, too, without reason. The mainstream media then lends a hand to Obama and his cohorts in crime by covering it all up, refusing to report. How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () March 4, 2017 Daily Wire reports, ‚ÄoeOur national media has known for months that the Obama administration spied on Team Trump. This was not only common knowledge within the media community, it was no secret. In fact, for two big reasons, the media was overjoyed that this spying had occurred: (1) they got scoops damaging to Trump, and (2) in their provincial and cultish minds, the very fact that the oh-so-pure Obama administration felt the need to spy, could only mean Trump was in bed with Putin.‚Äù As the spying and now investigations wear on, they find zero evidence of Trump colluding with Putin. Unfortunately, that doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter to the mainstream media. As the Circa News report comes out, the media hacks ignore it because to do otherwise would risk their hero Barry Obama, who could end up charged with crimes. So, every night, MSNBC, CNN, and every other liberal media outlet hammers home the fake Trump-Russia story instead. This is the biggest political scandal of the last 75 years. At the center of it are Barack Obama and the intel community colluding with the mainstream media to meddle in our election and stage a political coup to unseat our duly elected president. There is too much evidence now to deny this. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for the truth to come out and for all those involved to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
