During Behar‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s interview with Meyers, the comedian ruthlessly attacked the First Lady, saying she felt ‚Äoesorry for her.‚Äù ‚ÄoeHow do you frame Melania,‚Äù Meyers asked. ‚ÄoeAre you one of these people that has sympathy for Melania or do you think that we should judge her exactly like anybody with free will?‚Äù ‚ÄoeBut I feel sorry for her,‚Äù Behar said. ‚ÄoeShe had to sleep with him once. At least once she did. And then when she was in New York and we had to pay a million dollars a day to keep her here because she doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to sleep with him, we have to pay for that. I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like that.‚Äù ‚ÄoeCause I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to sleep with him, but nobody gives me any money,‚Äù Meyers responded. ‚ÄoeThey don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t pay my rent.‚Äù Then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gestures to his wife Melania after she delivered a speech on the first day of the Republican National Convention on July 18, 2016 at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.

Behar has attacked the Trump family for more than a year now. NBC Joy Behar at the premiere of ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Crisis in Six Scenes‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> in NYC (Dennis Van Tine/STAR MAX/IPx) Months ago, Behar insinuated on The View that Trump did not care about the future of his grandchildren, saying ‚ÄoePresident Trump has grandchildren also. It amazes me that he is not concerned about his grandchildren. What does that say about him?‚Äù John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at .
