Sitting down with Teen Vogue at Cannes Lions, Berry said her Oscar win ‚Äoemeant nothing.‚Äù ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s troubling to say the least,‚Äù Berry began, referencing the 2015 Oscar race, which spawned the ‚ÄoeOscars so white‚Äù controversy after zero non-white actors were nominated for a major award. ‚ÄoeI sat there and I really thought, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Wow, that moment really meant nothing. It meant nothing. I thought it meant something but I think it meant nothing.'‚Äù ‚ÄoeI was profoundly hurt by that, and saddened by that,‚Äù she added. Berry won the Oscar for Best Actress for Monster‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Ball at the 74th Academy Awards. In an emotional acceptance speech, Berry dedicated the award to ‚Äoeevery nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened.‚Äù ‚ÄoeIt inspired me to try to get involved in other ways, which is why I want to start directing,‚Äù Berry explained. ‚ÄoeI want to start producing more. I want to start making more opportunities for people of colour.‚Äù Echoing the sentiment now behind an industry-wide effort, Berry said studios must do more to increase diversity behind the camera. ‚ÄoeWe need more people of colour writing, directing, producing ‚Ä" not just starring,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄoeWe have to start telling stories that include us.‚Äù Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter:
