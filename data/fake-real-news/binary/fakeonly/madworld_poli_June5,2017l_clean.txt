President Donald Trump has warned us about fake news, but what just happened on a London street is downright ridiculous. CNN International got caught red-handed in a shocking video as they staged a pro-Muslim propaganda scene using a group of hijab-wearing women calling themselves ‚ÄoeMuslim Moms.‚Äù Trump is pissed, and he has a message of his own for these fake news scumbags. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s being called one of the biggest displays of mainstream media propaganda pieces pulled off by the anti-Trump liberals who align themselves with pro-Islamic terrorist groups like the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and with London Muslim Mayor, Sadiq Khan. CNN International (CNNi) brazenly staged a mock protest of ISIS using a group called ‚ÄoeMuslim Moms.‚Äù The intent of the scripted propaganda is clearly to create a counter storyline and reduce backlash against the political policies of the British government, but moreover, they are targeting President Donald Trump, who has made it clear that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s through playing games with groups like CAIR. Trump doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t give a damn about offending any Muslim group when it comes to keeping America safe. So, they staged this ridiculous scene to convey this message: ‚ÄoeLook at the moderate Muslims wearing hijabs who are out protesting ISIS. Trump is such a racist for wanting a travel ban. Love is the answer.‚Äù They want to fool Americans so we will put pressure on Trump to curb his strong terrorist policies which they see as ‚Äoeracist.‚Äù ‚ÄoeThe production staff go above and beyond by carefully positioning a group of women and children they call ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Muslim Mothers‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> complete with signs showing Muslim support for the UK electorate. Additionally, the staff place flowers and teddy bears at the feet of the women to create the best optics for the broadcast,‚Äù reports The Conservative Treehouse. A few of those who watched the entire creating of the media production begin to laugh in the background, and the woman in charge with the mic is Becky Anderson of CNNi. This is proof positive that the mainstream media is actually creating fake news to brainwash people. CNN caught staging news! They even brought "peace group" printed out papers and props.

Of course, CNN is denying the whole thing, which is par for the course. We know the media colludes with the liberals, creating messages that promote pro-Muslim migrant open borders, and you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re a racist if you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see things their way. Trump warned that this political correctness is hindering our capabilities and helping the Islamic terrorists. We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don't get smart it will only get worse ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 4, 2017 Then, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got the nutjob politicians like London‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Muslim Mayor Khan, who has a grudge against Trump. This guy, Sadiq Khan, openly talked crap about Donald Trump, saying he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know anything about stopping terror attacks. Well, with Islamic terror attacks hitting his own city, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Khan who is looking like the idiot who hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a clue on how to stop the murder and mayhem in London. Donald Trump doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have a clue about London ‚Ä" his comments are divisive and dangerous. I hope his campaign dies a death. ‚Ä" Sadiq Khan () December 8, 2015 Khan should be handing in his resignation as London‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mayor today. He has failed, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Sadiq Khan who doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have a clue about keeping the citizens he was elected to serve safe. Liberal losers, like Khan, are right here in America, standing for the same thing and playing the same games. Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren, and Chuck Schumer love Sadiq Khan and promote these same failing ideas on how to combat terrorism. The answer, keep draining the swamp. Continue to boycott all mainstream media. Support and defend our president who has proven he is putting America first. Never back down from calling out Islamic radicals who hate America and refuse to assimilate, back Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Muslim travel ban. Simply, be a patriot, like those who came before us. It wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t easy for them, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not for us, but we will make America great again, I have no doubt about that at all.
