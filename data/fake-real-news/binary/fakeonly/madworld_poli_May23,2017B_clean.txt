Agents for the leftist agenda who remained in place within our White House, known as Barack Obama holdovers, have been hard at work the past few months when it comes to trying to make President Donald Trump look as bad as possible. Although they were able to get a few digs in by leaking information, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re in for a world of hurt after learning what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s coming their way ‚Ä" and having their identities exposed is the least of their worries. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no arguing that the White House leakers have been able to dish out some damage in regards to Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presidency as they release classified information to create chaos among those suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome. As we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve come to learn, what they shared was hyper-exaggerated lies meant to cause outrage for the most part, but that matters little to those who are hellbent on hating our president. Unfortunately for those responsible, Trump said a while ago that he was going to find out who they were ‚Ä" and it looks like he most recently did just that. According to Young Conservatives, ‚ÄoeA reporter with One America News Network tweeted late Monday that three leakers have been identified inside the White House.‚Äù Although the identities have yet to be released to the public, journalist Trey Yingst explains that the names have been handed over to the Office of Government Ethics. Of course, this sounds extraordinarily boring, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s actually just the opposite. SCOOP: Three White House staffers have been identified for leaking classified info. POTUS will fire 'multiple people' when he returns to DC. ‚Ä" Trey Yingst () May 22, 2017 You see, the fact that their identities were handed over to this specific department can mean only one thing ‚Ä" the crap is about to hit the fan. ‚ÄoeI asked one source why the leakers names would be presented to the Office of Government Ethics,‚Äù Yingst said. ‚Äoe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>This is criminal,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> they said.‚Äù Although the Office of Government Ethics isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t able to prosecute anyone, they do play a heavy hand in advising the president on how to proceed with leakers. As we all know, those responsible aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t about to get any love from Trump, especially considering what they did to the man, as well as our nation, over the past few weeks. Although the leakers haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t been reported to have been fired yet, that may be solely for the sake of Trump being able to do it in person when he gets back. After all, he did promise to catch the ‚Äoelow-life‚Äù leakers, so who better to punish them now that they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been exposed? Democrats are so hypocritical that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll make your head spin. Remember just a few days ago when Trump was accused of sharing classified information about our enemy to Russia who is fighting that the same enemy? Then, it was ‚Äoeso important‚Äù to the left that we safeguard information, despite the fact that the accusations were false. However, when it comes to leakers sharing classified information that could potentially harm our nation, they will sacrifice our security if it means they get to take a shot at Trump. There is a glaring double standard here, and the left is actually playing a very dangerous game that could turn around and bite every single American in the end. After all, if everyone in the intelligence community valued classified information as little as they do, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d have no state secrets and be completely vulnerable as a nation. Fortunately, that isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the case, and the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s well is about to run dry when it comes to information on Trump. Of course, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll probably complain when he fires these nitwits too because of ‚Äoetransparency‚Äù or something of that nature, all the while complaining when he uses Twitter for transparency with the American people. If someone had done this to former president Barack Obama, could you imagine the outrage that would have ensued? The irony here is almost painful but not nearly as painful as the consequences these leakers are about to suffer, and no one should feel any empathy for them.
