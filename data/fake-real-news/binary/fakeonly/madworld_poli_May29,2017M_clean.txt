Memorial Day is meant for one thing; honoring the brave men and women who died while protecting the lives and freedom of all Americans. However, President Donald Trump has most recently made a drastic change to the holiday ‚Ä" and now, liberals are furious. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no arguing that President Trump is well on his way to making good on his campaign promise to ‚Äoemake America great again.‚Äù Of course, the left has done their best to obstruct his attempts, but they have been vastly unsuccessful at almost every turn. Most recently, Trump tipped his hat to the U.S. military yet again in order to show our brave men and women in uniform just how much he cares ‚Ä" something which was a rarity over the past 8 years. According to Fox News, Trump proclaimed Memorial Day, May 29, 2017, as a Day of Prayer for Permanent Peace. As the White House proclamation reads, ‚ÄoeMemorial Day is our Nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s solemn reminder that freedom is never free.‚Äù However, Trump wanted to take this sentiment to another level by actually trying to do something to show that each and every life is valued. ‚ÄoeI, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 29, 2017, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time when people might unite in prayer,‚Äù the statement reads. He also urged the ‚Äoepress, radio, television, and all other information media‚Äù not only to cooperate but take part in the act as well. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no arguing that Trump loves this country, but he takes that idea so much further when he shows the military his admiration. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why morale was suffering so badly under former President Barack Obama and why soldiers are more than happy to put their lives on the line now, under a leader who actually cares not only about our military but our country. Although they may have done the same under Obama, now they know they can do so for a grateful nation. Even better yet, they can do so for a Commander-in-Chief who actually respects them for what they do and appreciates the sacrifices they make. ‚ÄoeIt is a moment of collective reflection on the noble sacrifices of those who gave the last measure of devotion in service of our ideals and in the defense of our nation,‚Äù Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s proclamation continued. ‚ÄoeOn this ceremonious day, we remember the fallen, we pray for a lasting peace among nations, and we honor these guardians of our inalienable rights.‚Äù Unfortunately, bleeding heart liberals are furious over the matter: Peace? The man is a war monger trying to go to war with NK. Everything he says is a lie. He wants out of NATO. ‚Ä" Bravenak () May 29, 2017 Fucking IDIOT ! ‚Ä" 25th Ammendment!!! () May 29, 2017 Unless you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re a moron, world peace would be a very nice thing to accomplish, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to take a lot more than sheer will to make it happen. After all, what good is a handshake if only one person extends their arm? Everyone has to want it, and everyone must agree to act in a certain way. As we all know, there are many parts of the world that wish to see America‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s demise, preferably at their own hand. However, that isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t to say it isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worth praying for ‚Ä" and Trump made exactly that happen. Jesus clearly said in the Bible (Matthew 18:19) that ‚Äoeif two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.‚Äù If that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the case for just two people, imagine how seriously God must take an entire nation calling out to him for help.
