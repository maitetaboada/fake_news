I am a super fun guy. Everyone says it. I go to a lot of parties and at every one there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s always, like, a girl or two who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s like, ‚ÄoeHey, I love your viking hat. You must be a super fun guy.‚Äù They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re totes right, by the way. Even without the viking hat though, I am the guy who brings the party and leaves with your girlfriend. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m that fucking fun, man. But lately, shit‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been getting weird for me. Some neighbours have been calling the cops when I start pumping out my best jams. Like, I get that people work jobs or whatever, but when I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m slamming down the late-night beats with my bros and dealer, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s like, dude. Was it you? What the fuck? Why can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you just be more fun, man? I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m just living my best life. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s such a drag when the fuzz interrupt us when it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only, like, 4:30am and they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re all, ‚ÄoeExcuse me, Mr. Jeffries it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 4:30 AM on a Tuesday and this is your final warning,‚Äù Seriously, bro? Is that how you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to play me? The party was JUST getting started. And it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not like I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t invite you. I even knocked on your window that night while you and your wife were watching Netflix to invite you up for a late night jam sesh (PS: your wife is super hot, by the way). Your wife doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think that I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m creepy and that I should stop leaving my mixtapes on the hood of her car with those notes that make her ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>super uncomfortable‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, I think that you would have thought those beats were sick, if she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d just give them a chance. All you gotta do is let go, bro. Get into the music. Trust me, I get that life can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t always be a party. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got stresses too. I have to make, like, three child support payments per month and my mom‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dying words were that I was like, her ‚Äoebiggest regret in life.‚Äù It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hard to keep it going, man, but I just do me. I grab a brew, pop a pill, crank my tunes and I have the time of my FUCKING LIFE. The best part is this could be you. I mean, fuck car payments and mortgages or whatever you bankers are into nowadays. There is no way that being ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>stable‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> is better than drinking Nyquil because you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have enough cash to get a real six pack of PBR. It gets you fucked up all the same, bro. And I can tell you right now that after two bottles of that shit and a heavy dose of Dub, you are LOVING life. So next time, just cut me some slack, okay, man? Take off that tight-ass suit and slip on your party pants. I got glow sticks and rainbow tie-dye ‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>til the fucking sun comes up. We can hit a late night taco stand and then road trip to Burning Man, if you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re feeling it. The world‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s our oyster. And also if I could borrow, like $400 bucks tops for rent this month, that would be super rad. Thanks, man.
