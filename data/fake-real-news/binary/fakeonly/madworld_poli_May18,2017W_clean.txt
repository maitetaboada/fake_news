Things aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t looking too good these days for Nancy Pelosi, and her most recent appearance on live television just proved that. In fact, Democrats everywhere are in panic mode after their leader suffered an embarrassing ‚Äoemeltdown‚Äù during a press conference ‚Ä" and the best part comes as it was all caught on video. There are several theories out there pertaining to Pelosi and her wing bat behavior, but two are standing out above all the rest. When it comes down to it, quite a few people in America are convinced that the raving lunatic is either suffering from some sort of early onset mental deficiency, such as Alzheimer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s or dementia, or that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just constantly in a state of intoxication. Whatever the case may be, the loony Democrat has more than proven that she is no longer fit for the position in which she serves. Of course, that was clear the moment she started getting rich by abusing the power of her office ‚Ä" but it seems that her days may finally be numbered. Proving that to be the case was her most recent appearance during a press conference in which she attempted to criticize the appointment of an investigator to look into alleged hacking of the U.S. election. Unfortunately for her, things took an incredibly embarrassing turn when she suffered what appeared to be a brain freeze mid-sentence. In typical biased liberal fashion, Pelosi started off by saying that a former FBI Director, Robert Mueller, wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t good enough to lead an investigation into the alleged hacking of the U.S. election. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m still concerned that Director Mueller will still be subject to the supervision of the Trump-appointed leadership at the Justice Department,‚Äù she said. However, it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t long before onlookers started to notice that there was a problem. ‚ÄoeWe must remain vigilant to protect the integrity of, uh, (the) Mueller investigation. A special prosecutor cannot take the place of a truly independent, outside commission that is completely free from the Trump administration‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s meddling,‚Äù she added, but it was all downhill from there as things began to really fall apart. ‚ÄoeThe investigation that, uh, Muell, uh‚Ä¶ what do we call him now? Special, uh,‚Äù she mumbles, continuing to struggle, as The American Mirror suggests she may have even said, ‚ÄoeWhat are we talking about?‚Äù Trying to recover from the brain freeze, she continued, ‚ÄoeSpecial counsel Mueller is undertaking is about what has happened and is there wrongdoing?‚Äù Basically, what Pelosi showed the world is that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no longer able to keep her brain focused on a single topic for a brief period of time. Of course, most people would brush something like this off if it was a one-time deal, but at this point, Pelosi has suffered these kinds of issues more times that we can count. The fact of the matter here is that Pelosi is nothing more than a self-serving political hack who has abused our system of government to benefit herself financially. Although the left may be alright with that, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re now having to face some pretty serious truths about her state of mind. If Democrats want to be taken seriously, the first thing they need to do is purge Pelosi from the party once and for all. Of course, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to have an uphill battle convincing the world that the ‚Äoepolitician who cried Russia‚Äù wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t anything more than a raving lunatic.
