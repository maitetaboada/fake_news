Every week Beaverton editor-in-chief Luke Gordon Field assembles some of the countryâ€<sup>TM</sup>s best comedians and writers to talk, mock and riff their way through the news of the week. Then he puts their knowledge to the test in a very important quiz where the winner gets absolutely nothing. Part panel show, part interview, the Beaverton Weekly Report is an hilarious look at whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s going on in the world around us. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll be just like watching CNN, only funnier and with fewer erectile dysfunction ads. Luke is joined by podcaster Todd Van Allen, writer Eric Turkienicz and Second Jen creator/star Amanda Joy. They discuss the question on everyoneâ€<sup>TM</sup>s minds: who the fuck is Andrew Scheer (3:00)? But also: how great it feels to see Kellie Leitch lose so badly (6:00), missing Maxime Bernierâ€<sup>TM</sup>s dank memes (9:30), how the Liberals will deal with Andrew Scheer (15:00), the NDP/Green Party deal in B.C. (18:00), the potential Alberta-B.C. NDP feud (22:00) and Donald Trump being a sad little boy (26:00). Then the Approximately 10 Minute Long Quiz exposes how reality is but a mere construct, but in a fun way. Subscribe: iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, RSS Tags: Podcast, weekly report
