Michelle Obama seems to be getting quite comfortable in her newfound retirement. A little too comfortable, actually. In fact, she appears to have become so complacent that she has completely forgotten the decorum expected of a first lady because she recently embarked on a foul-mouthed rant aimed squarely at her husband‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s successor, President Donald Trump. Speaking at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference on Friday, May 12, Michelle made it clear just how bitter she is that the Trump administration decided to roll back the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act earlier this month. ‚ÄoeThis is where you really have to look at motives, you know? I mean, you have to stop and think, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Why don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you want our kids to have good food at school? What is wrong with you?'‚Äù said Michelle. ‚ÄoeAnd why is that a partisan issue? Why would that be political? What is going on?‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄoeThink about why someone is okay with your kids eating crap,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄoeWhy would you celebrate that? Why would you sit idly and be okay with that? Cause here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the secret: If somebody is doing that, they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care about your kid. And we need to demand everyone to care deeply about our kids. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all we have. So we should be driving this. Every elected official on this planet should understand: Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t play with our children. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do it.‚Äù While the former first lady‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s remarks were well-received by the liberal audience, they fell flat with millions of American mothers who don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t appreciate the way she insinuated that they are ‚Äoeokay with their kids eating crap.‚Äù Parents who are unsatisfied with the food options offered by their children‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s school simply pack a lunch for their kids. By the same token, parents who are content with their kids eating a lunch prepared by their school should be able to let them eat it without being chastised. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s none of the government‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s damn business what your and my children eat ‚Ä" that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s our business and ours alone. Anytime the government involves itself, you can expect to see all sorts of negative consequences, which is exactly what happened with Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s school lunch program. Of course, if Michelle Obama had stopped to think about the consequences that over-regulating a program which was running fine in the first place would have, perhaps her school lunch program would not have failed so miserably. The decision to roll it back had nothing to do with not wanting kids to have good food at school and everything to do with ensuring that schools across the country aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bankrupted. It should also be noted that there was nothing healthy at all about the slop served up courtesy of Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s government-regulated school lunches. Students were left hungry and unsatisfied after being limited to a dismal amount of calories at lunchtime, and the food choices which were offered appeared so grotesque that an alarming amount of waste was created. I think i will skip #ThanksMichelleObama 2 ‚Ä" ThanksMichelleObama () December 18, 2014 Would you eat that cause i sure as hell wouldnt #ThanksMichelleObama ‚Ä" ThanksMichelleObama () December 15, 2014 Moldy grapes anyone? ‚Ä" ThanksMichelleObama () December 15, 2014 Thats not even food #ThanksMichelleObama ‚Ä" ThanksMichelleObama () December 12, 2014 Each day, cafeteria workers and other staff would watch as students picked at their plates, only to throw the majority of their lunch away because it was so unappealing. Then, those same students were forced to go back to class with an empty stomach. In a nutshell, the program simply did not work. It created far more issues than it was worth, and it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worth much. Traditionally, first ladies choose a non-partisan cause to champion during their time in the White House. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s meant to be something which isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t controversial; something which everyone can get behind. For example, the lovely Laura Bush advocated for childhood literacy. Leave it to Michelle Obama to make millions of school kids miserable with her own cause. It wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have been quite so bad if she had focused on simply educating children regarding healthy food choices, and then allowed their parents to ultimately make those food choices for them. After all, that is the job of a parent. But, Mrs. Obama didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop there. She wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t content until she was effectively micro-managing every calorie consumed by students down to the salt and fat content in their chicken breast. Talk about controlling! Meanwhile, the former first lady was known to allow her own spoiled daughters to indulge in fattening treats like fried chicken and pizza. Talk about hypocrisy! It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no surprise that Michelle Obama is pissed to have had her signature legislation scrapped by President Donald Trump, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s unbecoming of a former first lady to get so worked up in public that she throws caution to the wind and lets the four-letter words fly. We always knew she wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the classiest broad, although she seems to be letting her inner Southside out now that she no longer resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, and it isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a good look.
