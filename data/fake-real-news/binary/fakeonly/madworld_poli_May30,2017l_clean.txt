Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell has made her feelings toward President Donald Trump perfectly clear. Unfortunately for her, it seems that the constant attacks over the past few months have resulted in a nasty, unforeseen consequence ‚Ä" and Trump had to be laughing hard as she dropped the news. Mad World News has reported several times on Rosie as she has attacked Trump at every turn. However, the non-stop barrage of negative comments haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t always worked out for her, and she recently proved that during a radio interview. According to Page Six, while speaking on John Fugelsang‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚ÄoeWTF Donny‚Äù comedy show, Rosie explained that her remarks have had some unforeseen consequences. In fact, her negativity has had such an impact that even her kids are feeling the unfortunate effects of her hostility. ‚ÄoeThis is the second time I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been in public since he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been elected because I go to the mall sometimes and Trump people go, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Hey f*ck you,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>‚Äù she explained. Of course, leave it to the entitled brat to say that same exact thing to someone else (word-for-word in a tweet to Trump) and then get mad at others for saying it to her. Furthermore, it seems that her self-obtained popularity has forced her into hiding as she admittingly doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like facing off with people willing to speak their mind. As we can see, Rosie doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mind the First Amendment when she gets to exercise it, but when others want to do the same, well, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d rather not hear what everyone else has to say. However, the worst part comes as Rosie states that her own kids have felt the wrath of backlash from their mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s obsessive Twitter rages against the president. ‚ÄoeThe boys in public school in New Jersey said to my 14-year-old daughter the next day, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Tell your mom I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m gonna grab your pussy,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>‚Äù she alleged. Of course, all Rosie can do is point the finger rather than take accountability for her own actions. She feels like she has the right to be as vile and vulgar as she wants because ‚ÄoeTrump deserves it,‚Äù but when she experiences the same thing, she apparently thinks she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s justified to complain about it. ‚ÄoeIt has affected my entire life and my entire family for a tremendous amount of years ‚Ä" over a decade,‚Äù she said of her long-running feud with Trump. You know, people with a lick of common sense would simply just try to avoid the people they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like ‚Ä" but not Rosie. Apparently, she thrives on the attention, so much, in fact, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s willing to disregard the happiness and well-being of her own children to get it. I mean, she already had one child leave her house because she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s unbearable. Now, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s well on her way of getting the rest to do the same, and of course, in typical liberal fashion, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s blaming Trump and his supporters without providing any proof that her allegations are true. When it comes down to it, Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell is getting everything she asked for. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get to pick a fight and expect the other person not to fight back. However, the fact that this pathetic liberal is willing to disregard her own children to keep a petty argument going shows exactly what kind of woman she really is ‚Ä" a desperate loser with nothing better in her life to focus on than creating drama and then crying about it. How sad.
