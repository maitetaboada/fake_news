Reports are beginning to surface surrounding the field trip that 11-year-old Barron Trump took last week, which was previously unknown to the press. Onlookers who witnessed the outing immediately noticed who was with President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s son. Barron Trump has nearly completed his final year at Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School in New York, but he isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t slacking off like many students do this late in the school year. Instead, the 11-year-old made sure to go out with a bang by inviting his entire fifth-grade class to tour the White House and meet his father. Last Wednesday, Barron and 80 of his classmates traveled by bus to Washington, D.C., accompanied by their teachers and Secret Service agents. There, the students were treated to a tour of the White House and a private meet-and-greet with President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. ‚ÄoeAll the kids got dressed up: The girls were in dresses and the boys wore khaki pants and button-downs. It was so cute,‚Äù a source told Page Six. ‚ÄoeThey had a buffet lunch and a tour of the White House and met the president and the first lady, Melania Trump,‚Äù the source continued. ‚ÄoePresident Trump gave them all a rousing speech about living up to your potential and being the best you could be for your country,‚Äù added the source. ‚ÄoeBarron was really sweet. He was so excited to show his classmates around the White House.‚Äù The large group of students also toured the nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s capital and stayed overnight at a hotel before traveling back to New York City on Thursday. Melania and Barron will be relocating to Washington, D.C., once the 11-year-old finishes out the school year in New York. The First Family has decided that he will begin attending the prestigious St. Andrew‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Episcopal School in Potomac, Maryland, beginning in the fall. After his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shock election victory and his inauguration as president, Barron stayed behind with his mother at Trump Tower so that he could finish up his studies at Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School, which is located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. There was speculation as to which school Barron would attend, but the decision to send the boy to the Potomac, Maryland, institution was announced by the White House on Monday. The tuition at the school costs over $38,000 per year, and he will be the first presidential child to attend the coeducational college preparatory school that was founded in 1978 and educates about 580 students from prekindergarten through 12th grade.

He is truly a model father, just as he is a model president. No doubt, Barron will follow in the footsteps of his successful and talented older siblings, who have all made their father and their country very proud.
