When a pair of teen girls showed up to the student fashion show at their high school, they looked exuberant in bright pink dresses. However, upon closer glance, parents were horrified to see what their outfits were made out of. The girls, clad in dresses made from hot pink condoms and stickers, apparently thought that their school fashion show was the perfect place to plug Planned Parenthood. Two teens from a private progressive New York high school showed their support for Planned Parenthood by creating dresses for their school‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fashion show out of the abortion vendor‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bright pink stickers and condoms. [Source: Breitbart] According to BuzzFeed, students Karolina Montes, 17, and Zoe Balestri, 16 ‚Ä" both juniors at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School (ECFS) in the Bronx ‚Ä" said their goal was to educate people about Planned Parenthood. ‚ÄoeWe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been best friends since 6th grade,‚Äù said Balestri. ‚ÄoeThis year we thought after everything that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been happening in the world and with this country, it was important to make our dresses beautiful and fun but also to give them some sort of meaning. We decided this was the perfect way to support something we both strongly believed in.‚Äù These Planned Parenthood Dresses Totally Stole One High School's Fashion Show 8 via ‚Ä" ECFS () May 25, 2017 Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s be honest. Planned Parenthood isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t interested in teens having safe sex. They make their money off of abortions. It behooves them for teenagers to have unplanned pregnancies ‚Ä" the more, the better, in their eyes ‚Ä" so the company has a steady flow of ‚Äoecustomers.‚Äù This is precisely why Planned Parenthood offers expectant mothers no options for prenatal care, despite what the left will tell you. Go ahead, give it a try. Call your local Planned Parenthood branch and tell them you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d like a prenatal appointment. I dare you. They won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t give you one. In fact, they can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. They do not have the equipment or staff to take care of a pregnant woman. They do, however, have everything needed to kill her child. This is the reality of what these teen girls were advocating at their school fashion show, although it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s likely they had no idea. Planned Parenthood is sorely misrepresented because if everyone knew the reality of the situation, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no way the company could continue to operate. Regardless of whether the girls knew the reality of everything Planned Parenthood stands for, though, it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t negate the fact that their little stunt was entirely inappropriate. Neither their parents nor their teachers should have allowed them to wear the dresses they created out of condoms and stickers. But, sadly, our culture seems to slip further and further down a dangerous slope of debauchery as each day passes. This sex-crazed student fashion show is just the latest example, but make no mistake, it will not be the last.
