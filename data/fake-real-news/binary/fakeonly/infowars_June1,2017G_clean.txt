Hillary Clinton is still blaming everyone apart from herself for her election loss ‚Ä" almost seven months later. During an on stage interview at the Code Conference today, Clinton ran through the usual baseless conspiracy theory about Russia coordinating with Wikileaks to sabotage her campaign. Hillary claimed that the Podesta emails were leaked one hour after the Access Hollywood ‚Äoepussy‚Äù tape was released in order to eclipse the former, despite the fact that it did no such thing because the news cycle was completely dominated by Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoegrab her by the pussy‚Äù comment for days afterwards. ‚ÄoeWithin one hour, the Russians, Wikileaks, same thing, dumped the John Podesta emails,‚Äù said Hillary, before claiming that the Podesta emails were ‚Äoeanodyne to boredom,‚Äù while simultaneously asserting that they swung the entire election (pick one Hillary because you can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have both). ‚ÄoeWithin one hour they dumped them and they began to weaponize them, and they began to have some of their allies within the Internet world like Infowars take out pieces and begin to say the most outlandish, outrageous, absurd lies you can imagine,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄoeHe dumps that on me on October 28th and I immediately start falling,‚Äù said Hillary in reference to the Comey memo (which she also claims was motivated by the Russians. Hillary also blamed ‚ÄoeTrump people‚Äù screaming ‚Äoelock her up, lock her up‚Äù as a reason for her defeat as well as Google searches being predominantly for Wikileaks in the final days of the campaign. She goes on to call the Wikileaks Podesta dump ‚Äoefalse information‚Äù despite earlier claiming it was ‚Äoeanodyne‚Äù and boring. To witness Hillary still stuck in denial nearly seven months after the election would be tragic if it were not so hilarious. We can only hope that the left remains mired in its Trump Derangement Syndrome for the next three and a half years, because the total lack of capacity for self-reflection and a change of tactics will only result in one outcome ‚Ä" another term for the Donald.
