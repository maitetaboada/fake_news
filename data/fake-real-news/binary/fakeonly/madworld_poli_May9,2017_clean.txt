Although Maxine Waters has been recently lifted to hero status by the left for her ignorant calls to impeach President Donald Trump, that may all be about to change. In fact, liberals are in a downright panic after the shocking admission she made for all the world to hear ‚Ä" and the worst part came as her remarks were said during a live interview, so there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no taking them back. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d have to be a moron to believe anything that Maxine Waters says. Still, it seems that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s surprisingly managed to developed a bit of a following that stems from nothing more than her outlandish, constant cries for President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s impeachment. With her biased remarks only garnering support on account of partisanship, most people who are capable of thinking for themselves view her as a complete and utter embarrassment to politics. Of course, that sentiment has most heavily come from the right, but now, it seems that a few on the left are finally starting to see things the way they really are. As it turns out, this reality has only finally come to be after a shocking admission that Waters made during a live interview with Cape Up radio host Jonathan Capehart, where the deranged Democrat went so far as to flat-out admit that there is zero evidence of ‚Äoecollusion‚Äù between President Trump and Russia. ‚ÄoeYou leveled a whole lot of accusations out there about collusion and hacking and all of that. Now have you seen anything ‚Ä" either in intelligence briefings or anything ‚Ä" to back up the accusations that you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve made?‚Äù Capehart asked Waters, according to The American Mirror. ‚ÄoeDon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t forget, all of our intelligence agencies said, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Yes, they have the documentation they did the hacking‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> on the DNC, and some of us,‚Äù Waters responded, to which Capehart interjected, ‚ÄoeBut the collusion, though?‚Äù ‚ÄoeNo, we have not,‚Äù Waters admitted. ‚ÄoeAnd that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why the investigations are so important ‚Ä" to drill down and connect those dots and to get the facts.‚Äù Of course, she went on to pull a stunt like her wing-bat friend Nancy ‚Äoeyou have to pass it to see what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in it‚Äù Pelosi by saying that we need an investigation to see if there was any wrongdoing. However, she has literally no proof to even make such an accusation, which she has most recently made perfectly clear. At this point, the entire Trump/Russia story is nothing more than rumors spread by jealous Democrats. For some reason, though, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been able to say it enough times to convince the leftist media and a portion of the public that it might be true. Now, Congress is having to spend taxpayer dollars to take part in a ridiculous investigation to prove what we already know ‚Ä" there is no proof of these frivolous claims. Unfortunately for Waters, this is actually bad news for her, seeing how she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only been able to develop her recent popularity by crying for Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s impeachment. Not only has she just admitted that there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no proof of what she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been spewing all along, but she ultimately announced that there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nothing to impeach Trump over. Waters may be enjoying her moment in the sun, but when her clueless supporters finally get around to figuring out that her claims were as empty as her head, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll turn on her. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only a matter of time. There is as much loyalty on the left as there are brains ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really saying something when you have this moron calling for President Trump to be impeached while announcing to the world that they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re talking about.
