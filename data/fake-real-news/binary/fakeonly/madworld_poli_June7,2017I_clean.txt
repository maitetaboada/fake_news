Rep. Nanette Barragan (D-CA) held a town hall event last week at Stephen M. White School in Carson, California, and footage has now surfaced of what turned out to be quite an embarrassing moment for her. As soon as the liberal lawmaker realized who was waiting for her inside the venue, she turned to flee the premises. According to The Gateway Pundit, in the opening minutes of Rep. Barragan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s town hall meeting, she was shocked as the predominately pro-Trump crowd began screaming and chanting, ‚ÄoeWe Love Trump!‚Äù and ‚ÄoeRespect Our President!‚Äù Surprisingly, this happened in the Democratic stronghold of California. It all began when the congresswoman failed to begin the meeting by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Obviously offended by her lack of respect for the country which has provided her with so much, attendees began shouting that she should ‚Äoehonor our country.‚Äù They then took matters into their own hands by loudly pledging allegiance to the flag with their hands over their hearts. This was not the end of the congresswoman‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s embarrassment, though. As Barragan started to say, ‚ÄoeWe have a president who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s acting like he can do whatever he wants to do‚Ä¶,‚Äù she was quickly interrupted by the Trump supporters, who began screaming at her to have some respect for our Commander-in-Chief. Unable to handle a roomful of her constituents who actually like President Donald Trump, Barragan, who is in her first term, quickly cut and ran from the meeting, choosing not to move forward by hearing from the people she was elected to represent. The Democrats have had their fair share of embarrassing moments at town hall events lately. Last week, illegal aliens and immigration activists gathered in Santa Ana, California, for a meeting with Rep. Lou Correa, but violence erupted and arrests were ultimately made when the liberals couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t play nicely with Trump supporters. As we have seen in the past, the Democrats seem to have a serious aversion to a difference of opinion. What is happening at various town halls across the country is living proof of that fact. Donald Trump is our president, and it should offend absolutely no one that Americans support him. The very last people it should offend are members of Congress, who have been elected to work with President Trump for the good of those in their district. Rep. Barragan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s embarrassing town hall meeting was a sure sign that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not cut out for a career in politics and does not belong in Washington, D.C. If this event was any indication, this will likely be her first and final term in Congress.
