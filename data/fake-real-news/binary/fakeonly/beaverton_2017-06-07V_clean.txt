This is crazy! Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve been sitting at this Mandarin buffet by myself for 2 hours and no one stops me from getting up and helping myself to more plates of delicious noodles. Not small plates either, I fill the plate so high I usually drop at least a 1lb of noodles walking back to my table. It all started when I was walking past this mandarin buffet. I saw that juicy juicy tray of noodles and knew where I would be eating lunch. From there it only got better! I didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have to wait for someone to bring me noodles. I was given a plate and allowed to go straight into the kitchen and serve myself like 45 noodles. As I was finishing my initial plates of noodles I noticed someone get up, walk straight into the kitchen, and steal some crab legs and fried rice! Being a responsible citizen I reported the theft to a manager. The manager then informed me that it wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t theft â€" patrons could go up and get new food any time we wanted. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a good thing because I was putting noodles away at a truly gut wrecking pace! I know what youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re thinking â€<sup>~</sup>the bill at the end of the night will be for like $7000 because of all those noodlesâ€<sup>TM</sup>. But I asked one of the servers if I would be charged for the additional plates of noodles and she no. I know some people only like the Mandarinâ€<sup>TM</sup>s authentic Chinese food such as mashed potato, corn or pizza. But I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t get enough of these noodles. I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want to overdo it though, Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m just going to have another three plates of noodles, hide some more noodles under my clothes, then head home. But you better believe Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m coming back and doing the same thing for my 65th birthday. Tags: bill, Birthday, Chinese, Mandarin, noodles
