Ruben Hernandez, a 29-year-old illegal alien from Mexico, is accused of driving drunk and hitting a family of four in their Nissan SUV, according to Valley Central News. In the SUV was two-year-old Acel Cuellar, along with another boy, a man, and a woman. While the man and woman are still in stable condition and the second child has been released from the hospital, Acel died following the crash. Hernandez is being charged with three separate counts of intoxication assault, as well as intoxication manslaughter for the death of the toddler. Hernandez is being held on a $1 million bond. Earlier this week, Breitbart Texas reported on the death of a seven-year-old boy in a border city just outside the U.S. by cartel gunman: The murder of seven-year-old Omar Emiliano Vazquez took place when he and his father Jorge Vazquez were riding in a dark Ford pickup on the highway that connects this border city with San Fernando. The family was returning home from working at their ranch. In the Balcones neighborhood, a group of cartel gunmen in a red Ford Focus pulled alongside them and tried to force the family off the road. The boyâ€<sup>TM</sup>s father accelerated to get away, however, the maneuver proved fatal. The cartel gunmen began firing at the pickup. While the family managed to outrun the killers, one round struck seven-year-old Omar in the head, killing him before his relatives could get to a hospital. Reynosa, Mexico, which sits directly outside of Hidalgo, Texas on the U.S. border, is known for its violence and most recent wars between rivaling groups within the Gulf Cartel.
