Everyone remembers the classic sitcom Modern Family, the story of a uniquely â€" and hilariously! â€" structured California family and their struggles to navigate their ever-changing family dynamics. But have you ever wondered whatever happened to the actors who played some of your favourite characters? Read below to learn about where they are today. 1) Ed Oâ€<sup>TM</sup>Neill jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery("#MF1").twentytwenty(); }); Everyoneâ€<sup>TM</sup>s favourite family patriarch, Jay Pritchett, was played by Married with Children alumnus Ed Oâ€<sup>TM</sup>Neill. But did you know that heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s gone on to continue to play the role of Jay Pritchett on Modern Family, still airing today? Wow! 2) Sofia Vergara jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery("#MF2").twentytwenty(); }); Jayâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Colombian firecracker wife Gloria was played by bombshell Sofia Vergara. Modern Family was her breakout role and she parlayed that initial fame into playing Gloria Pritchett some more. You can now see her filming the next season of Modern Family wherever it is that they do that! 3) Julie Bowen jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery("#MF3").twentytwenty(); }); Dunphy mom, Claire, was played by actress Julie Bowen. Realizing her strengths of playing a harried homemaker, Bowen continued to get similar roles, namely as Claire Dunphy in subsequent seasons of the show, now eight years running. 4) Ty Burrell jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery("#MF4").twentytwenty(); }); Ty Burrell won two Emmys as Dunphy dad, Phil during his time with the show. You can now catch Burrell trying to make it three by playing Phil Dunphy on Modern Family! 5) Ariel Winter jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery("#MF5").twentytwenty(); }); Audiences watched Ariel winter literally grow up on screen as middle Dunphy child Alex. Sadly, Winter had difficulty finding roles other than Alex and now the only place eagle-eyed viewers can see her is as middle Dunphy child Alex on Modern Family, a wildly popular show that will likely be on the air forever. 6) Eric Stonestreet jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery("#MF6").twentytwenty(); }); Eric Stonestreet may not be gay but he sure did a great job playing Cam, one half of a same-sex couple on Modern Family. Rumour has it that Stonestreet is being courted by ABC to sign on to film promotional spots for the upcoming season of Modern Family, a show which has been on and continues to be on to this day. 7) Rico Rodriguez jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery("#MF7").twentytwenty(); }); Modern Family was a great show for young child actors who never age and thereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s no exception when it comes to Rico Rodriguez, who played Manny Delgado. Rodriguez became stressed by the rigorous scheduling of filming and only returned to TV periodically every year for an average 24 episodes of Modern Family. Rico has enjoyed a recent run on the late-night talk show circuit, plugging his role in Modern Family. 8) Stephen Tobolowsky jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery("#MF8").twentytwenty(); }); Playing the role of Cam and Mitchellâ€<sup>TM</sup>s daughter Lily, famed character actor Stephen Tobolowsky has delighted fans with his adorable performance. A recent episode where Lily loses her long-term memory was seen as a subtle nod to Tobolowskyâ€<sup>TM</sup>s role in Memento. Tobolowsky will be playing Lily for the foreseeable future on Modern Family â€" a show that is always the funniest thing on television and pushes every boundary and is the best forever!
