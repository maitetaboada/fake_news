Megyn Kelly just can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get a break with her new gig at NBC. She is freaking out after the deleted scenes from her interview with Vladimir Putin were leaked to the press. Kelly demanded NBC ‚Äoecut that part out,‚Äù where Putin makes her look like an idiot. She was using Putin, hoping to manipulate him to shed a bad light on President Donald Trump, and you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll love how that all backfired as she got slapped with a nasty surprise by Putin. NBC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Megyn Kelly recently interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin, where she kept pushing Putin on the ‚Äoeelection interference‚Äù hoax, and he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t having it. NBC cut out a scene where Vladimir Putin absolutely destroyed Kelly after she asked about his interaction with former National Security Adviser General Flynn. Putin even suggested that, by her own logic, Kelly should be arrested because of the amount of interaction she has now had with him. When Megyn Kelly brought up Russian Ambassador Kislyak and wanted to know what was discussed in his meetings with the U.S., Putin mocked her, saying, ‚ÄoeWhat do you think from all over the world or from the U.S. the ambassador reports to me every day with whom he meets and what he discusses? This is a nonsense of some sort. Do you understand what you are asking or not?‚Äù Megyn Kelly responds sheepishly, ‚ÄoeWell, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re his boss!‚Äù Putin explained that he had very little contact with Flynn compared to Megyn Kelly and that by her own standards, she should be ‚Äoearrested and put in jail.‚Äù NBC deletes scene of Putin joking w/ Megyn Kelly that she would be jailed by standards used to investigate Flynn's ties to Russia. Amazing! ‚Ä" Josh Caplan () June 7, 2017 Mr. Putin told Ms. Kelly the issue of Moscow‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s connections with Donald Trump and allegations of interference with US elections had been ‚Äoeselected by someone as a line of attack against the current US president.‚Äù Then, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Oliver Stone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s take on Kelly. He is no conservative out to protect Trump, yet he calls her sloppy and says she was out to fulfill a narrative. ‚ÄoeFilm director Oliver Stone, whose series of conversations with Vladimir Putin air next week on Showtime, said he watched Megyn Kelly interview the Russian president on NBC and concluded that ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>he knew his stuff and she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t,'‚Äù reports ABC News. As an example of where he believed Kelly was mistaken, Stone said the claim that 17 U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded the Russians were behind election hacking, which she used as a preface for a question, had been ‚Äoewalked back.‚Äù This is exactly why the public distrusts the mainstream media, and rightfully so. The embarrassing exchange between Kelly and Putin is newsworthy and important. Putin is not a friend of the United States, but he makes an important point about General Flynn and how the media has blown up this whole Russia conspiracy with members of the Trump campaign. Megyn Kelly has had it in for President Trump ever since that first debate, and she came up with a big fat zero in Russia as Putin swatted her questions away without breaking a sweat. Kelly isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the next Barabra Walters, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just another liberal media hack.
