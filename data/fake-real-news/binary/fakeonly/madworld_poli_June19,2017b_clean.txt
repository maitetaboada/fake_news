Kamala Harris has reached a new, all-time low. The rude, obnoxious junior senator from California launched a fundraising scheme, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s backfiring big time. Harris is well-known as the shrew who acted like her hair was on fire on Capitol Hill while questioning Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Admiral Mike Rogers. Playing the tired ‚Äoewoman card,‚Äù she banked on cashing in on her rude behavior, but instead, all she got was a nasty surprise. Kamala Harris thinks her rude, crude, ridiculous rants during the Senate hearings on Capitol Hill will make her rich. Harris is trying to cash in using her ‚Äoewoman card,‚Äù depicting what happened to her during the hearings as some great moment in American politics for all women. Harris‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> delusions of grandeur caused her to pin a tweet to the top of her Twitter page that refers to her being ‚Äoesilenced‚Äù and links to a donations page: The women of the United States Senate will not be silenced when seeking the truth. Fight back: ‚Ä" Kamala Harris () June 13, 2017 On the donation page, Harris claims, ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s happened to me, Elizabeth Warren, and countless others. Too often women are silenced in society and in the Senate. Make a contribution to defend the women of the Senate and fight back.‚Äù Wow. This woman is one big liar, and Americans with even half a brain aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t falling for her sick attempt at fundraising. ‚ÄoeWhile she claims she was ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>silenced,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> in each case Harris was actually the silencer, talking over witnesses such as Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. In each case, the witnesses protested that she was not letting them answer her questions. Sessions, in particular, complained that by cutting him off, she was exposing him to legal risk of not telling the whole truth,‚Äù reports Breitbart. Harris got a nasty surprise after she posted the fundraising scheme on social media. Seventy-five percent of the comments are negative, calling her out as a swamp creature that has to go. Grandstanding and showboating at the Senate hearings doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t translate into big cash donations. Because when we ask questions, were not really looking for answers, we just like to hear ourselves talk & use our vaginas as an excuse ‚Ä" Lola üá∫üá∏ () June 14, 2017 Sessions was answering her questions. Kamala Harris was SHOWBOATING for personal gain & fundraising for Senate run Not there to learn truth. ‚Ä" Donna () June 13, 2017 Harris has tried to make a name for herself by trolling Donald Trump on Twitter, as the San Diego Tribune reports, ‚ÄoeIs California Sen. Kamala Harris running for president in 2020? She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sure acting like it, at least on Twitter. Since President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s inauguration, the Senate rookie has sent more than 80 Trump-related tweets in 14 days. Each time, in just 140 characters or less, Harris has trolled him on his policies, his cabinet nominees and more.‚Äù Trolling the master of Twitter didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t work for Harris, but then again, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s got nothing else to fall back on. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the epitome of a swamp creature, getting her start in politics as San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mistress. ‚ÄoeThe first time [Kamala Harris] ever appears in a Nexis.com search of California news is March 22, 1994, when she was Assembly Speaker Willie Brown‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s date at his 60th birthday party. She was 30 years-plus younger. But she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t just date Brown. She cashed in from knowing him,‚Äù reports CalWatchdog. Kamala Harris is shaping up to be a female Barack Obama. With only one term as a U.S. Senator, there is already a lot of talk about a serious bid for president in 2020. She, like Obama, has a sketchy background. Besides the gender card, she plays the race card, even though her mother is from India and she used to identify as an ‚ÄoeIndian-American.‚Äù Now, she identifies as an African-American, although her father, who left her mother when she was seven, is Jamaican-American. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s one huge problem with Harris running in 2020. Never again will patriotic Americans be duped into voting for someone solely based on their race or gender. Harris can take her fake gender card fundraising and go back to California where she belongs. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a big-mouthed swamp creature who is heading for the Washington, D.C., drain. After Obama, Americans won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be fooled again.
