When ‚ÄoeJeopardy!‚Äù champion Ken Jennings heard that Barron Trump panicked while seeing Kathy Griffin holding the fake severed head of his father, the contestant repeatedly mocked the child. However, just moments after bullying the 11-year-old boy, Jennings was introduced to something from which even his intellect couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t save him. Although disgraced comedienne Kathy Griffin learned a hard lesson in using extreme political stunts to reignite her relevance, record-holding Jennings didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem to identify her career-ending move as such. In fact, despite the intellectual ‚Äoegenius‚Äù boasting an enviable IQ, he strangely deduced that poking fun at a child‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s recent traumatic reaction would boost his celebrity status. Unfortunately for him, he not only failed to induce a few chuckles but may have buried his career in the process. After photos and footage surfaced of a straight-faced Griffin raising a bloodied mask depicting the grisly beheading of President Donald Trump, reports surfaced that 11-year-old Barron screamed out in horror as he had believed that the grotesque portrayal was real. Unbelievably, Jennings took the outrage over this disturbing stunt as an opportunity not only to trivialize Griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ultra-violent display but have a laugh at the frightened child. When Donald Trump Jr. called out his comment, Jennings deleted the ill-humored tweet but stupidly doubled down on his comments, blaming the White House for allegedly using Barron‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s terror for political gain. Despite being called out twice for his atrocious responses, Jennings once again defended his ridicule of the first family, tweeting several more distasteful jabs, according to Breitbart. I will kill as many white rhinos as it takes to prove my masculinity to Donald Trump Jr. ‚Ä" Ken Jennings () May 31, 2017 After snubbing multiple opportunities to correct his behavior, Jennings realized that he had made, as Trump would say, a ‚Äoeyuge‚Äù mistake. Daily Mail reports that Twitter followers began inundating Simon & Schuster, the publisher for Jennings‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> children‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s book series, demanding the company cut ties with him. Social media users questioned how an author could write children‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s literature but bully individuals from his own target audience simply because he disagrees with his politician father. Simon & Schuster 1 (800) 223-2336, then option 4. ‚Ä" Feetiesandtoes () May 31, 2017 I don't give a damn if you agree or not. You target little kids, while writing kids books‚Ä¶ He has it coming ‚Ä" Brook () May 31, 2017 I called Simon Schuster & reported that Ken Jennings has engaged in bullying 11 yr old Barron Trump. They are giving a statement later today ‚Ä" James A. Witomski () June 1, 2017 Jennings prides himself on being politically incorrect, yet many of his comments are not simply insensitive but unethical, especially to his profession. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disturbing that Jennings, who has a young daughter who turns 11 this year, finds it comical that a child suffered the mental anguish of believing he had just seen his daddy horrifically murdered. Perhaps Jennings wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think it was so humorous if his own child was made to believe that someone had beheaded him on television. The biggest issue with Jennings‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> comments is that he knows very well that his ‚Äoejokes‚Äù crossed the line but chooses to wield his wit to twist his repugnant intentions. Fortunately, his defense didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t convince the internet as followers unfollowed, chastised, and reported his comments to his publisher. Jennings perfectly portrays the typical liberal elitist, arrogantly parading his intellect as inarguable to his dissidents. However, the brilliance he boasts in abundance is overshadowed by his callous disconnect from human decency. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d think that a brainiac like Jennings would comprehend that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not a good idea to attack hurting children but that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s merely a staple of the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s intolerance.
