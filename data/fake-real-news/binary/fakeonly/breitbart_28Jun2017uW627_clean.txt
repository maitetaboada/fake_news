The video, released by O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Keefe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Project Veritas, titled ‚ÄoeAmerican Pravda: CNN Part 2,‚Äù shows an unidentified journalist greeting Jones and saying they had met before. The video then skips to a part of the conversation where the journalist asks, ‚ÄoeWhat do you think is going to happen this week with the whole Russia thing?‚Äù: NEW VIDEO: on camera, says 's #russia narrative "just a big nothing burger" See the whole video: ‚Ä" James O'Keefe () June 28, 2017 ‚ÄoeThe Russia thing is just a big nothing burger,‚Äù Jones, who served as a green jobs czar to the Obama administration, replies. The video appears to have been taken on June 26 outside CNN‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s offices on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. When the journalist follows up, Jones says, ‚ÄoeThere‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nothing there you can do.‚Äù It is not clear if Jones is referring to the Russia controversy itself being a ‚Äoenothing burger‚Äù or the congressional or FBI investigations into alleged ties between Russia and Trump officials. Project Veritas does not give any further context to Van Jones‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s remarks. As O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Keefe points out in the video, Jones and CNN have pushed the Russia-Trump narrative in recent months. This latest Project Veritas CNN-targeted video shows a clip from December in which Van Jones refers to an ‚Äoeactive attack of the country‚Äù by Russia. The latest video comes after another video showed a senior CNN producer suggesting the Russia controversy is ‚Äoemostly bullshit.‚Äù In ‚ÄoeAmerican Pravda: CNN Part 1,‚Äù the Project Veritas video released the previous day, CNN producer John Bonifield is shown saying it ‚Äoecould be bullshit. I mean, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mostly bullshit right now‚Äù when asked about his thoughts on the Russia investigation. ‚ÄoeLike, we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have any giant proof. Then they say, well there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s still an investigation going on. And you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re like, yeah, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know. If they were finding something, we would know about it.‚Äù Bonifield also was caught on camera saying the reason CNN leadership and management is so focused on the Russia scandal is ‚Äoebecause it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ratings.‚Äù ‚ÄoeOur ratings are incredible right now,‚Äù the video from Project Veritas shows Bonifield saying. CNN later issued a statement in support of Bonifield, saying, ‚ÄoeDiversity of personal opinion is what makes CNN strong, we welcome it and embrace it.‚Äù Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.
