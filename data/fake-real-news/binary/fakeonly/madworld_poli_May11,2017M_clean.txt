Police recently launched a massive search effort for a man after finding a 6-year-old child barely clinging to life. Unfortunately, they would later learn that the suspect was an illegal immigrant. This kid might have been spared if the borders were properly secured, ensuring he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make it back after being previously deported 15 times, but a liberal judge‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s order made it clear who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s life is more important to him. It all started with a little trip to Disneyland. However, the ride home for 6-year-old Lennox Lake and his family would quickly take a turn. According to Daily Caller, their car was violently struck in a suburb of San Diego, California ‚Ä" but that wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the worst part. As it turns out, the driver of the other car would flee the scene, leaving the family injured, suffering, and without any help. It would later be learned that the offending motorist was actually a Mexican national in the country illegally who went by the name Constantino Banda-Acosta. Making matters worse, the man had been deported from America a whopping 15 times since 2002 ‚Ä" and he still somehow was able to make his way back into the country. Now, because of his unauthorized and unwelcome presence here, Banda drove his truck through a stop sign and hit the car of an unsuspecting family, leaving their young child in need of serious medical care. The speeding Chevrolet Silverado hit the driver and passenger‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s side where the boy, Lennox Lake, was sitting in his car seat, said his grandmother, Cheryl Lake. The boy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father, Benjamin, became trapped. His wife, Ingrid, crawled out of the front passenger seat and rushed to aid Lennox, who was unconscious, not breathing and bleeding from his nostrils, ears and head, his grandmother said. The child suffered a major head injury and was taken to a hospital. As of Tuesday night, he had undergone two surgeries at Rady Children‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Hospital, Cheryl Lake said. [Source: San Diego Union-Tribune] Although Banda would try to flee, it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t long before police caught up to the man and placed him under arrest. He is currently facing charges of drunk driving, hit-and-run, and driving without a license. Also, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is very interested in him as well. The family has opened a GoFundMe account in hopes of raising money for the boy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s medical bills. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve also provided the public with a more in-depth description of what happened to Lennox as well as a few updates since: Lennox sustained an open skull fracture with the location being slightly above his left eye. He had initial surgery to repair the outside wound over the left eyebrow area, which took about 6 stitches. He later had another surgery which involved opening the scalp at the hairline, peeling it off the skull to expose the damage, irrigating the area (which flushed out some small piece of bone but no debris. ) Then they positioned the depressed bone and stitched him back up.

Unfortunately, this is the exact threat that illegal immigration poses to our society. Now, because Democrats and liberals virtually opened the border in the name of multiculturalism, a child is recovering in the hospital from extensive injuries. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know about you, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve about had it with the excuses, and at this point, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to hold every bleeding heart liberal who calls for open borders responsible every time something like this happens to an innocent American citizen.
