According to Inc, Unilever, which owns a variety of popular brands including Ben and Jerry‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s, Lipton, Dove, and Magnum, starts by putting targeted adverts online. ‚ÄoeUnilever redirects those who click on the ads to sites where they could apply for entry-level positions,‚Äù Inc explained. ‚ÄoeThe company pulls the individuals‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> LinkedIn profile data to fill out much of the application. Unilever‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s algorithm scans all the applications that people submit, getting rid of more than half of the candidates.‚Äù ‚ÄoeThe candidates who make it past the algorithm play a set of 12 short online games, which test factors like short-term memory,‚Äù they continued. ‚ÄoeUnilever invites the top third (or less) of the candidates who complete the games to submit a video interview on HireVue. The questions focus on how the candidates would respond to business challenges. Final candidates are invited for an in-person interview with Unilever human resources executives and managers.‚Äù For video interviews, Unilever has ‚Äoeprogrammed their technology to measure specific elements, such as vocabulary, facial expressions and question response speed.‚Äù According to the report, ‚ÄoeThese factors theoretically can reveal clues about the applicants‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> education, intelligence, personality and emotional stability. Unilever thus still gets a concept of whether the applicant would fit in well at the company despite the fact humans don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get involved in the hiring process until the last step.‚Äù The tech-heavy process is one that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s reportedly mirrored at companies such as Goldman Sachs and Walmart, who also allegedly use algorithm‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in the hiring process.
