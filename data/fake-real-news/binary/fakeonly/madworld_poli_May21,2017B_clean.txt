Barack and Michelle Obama are playing political games, and Michelle was just caught on a secret trip trying to undermine Melania Trump. Everything the Obamas do is tied to their goals, which they have made clear is to resist President Donald Trump. So, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not shocking that Michelle just turned up in the one place overseas that is causing a showdown with Melania. Luckily, her game playing went all wrong. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to love this. The Obamas do nothing on a whim, so it was not shocking that they planned to be in Italy at the same time as the First Family. This trip was kept secret until Michelle made her presence known in a little Italian town, as her minions yelled for the cameras, ‚ÄoeWe miss you, Michelle!‚Äù Those who were yelling that they missed her were not Italians, but clearly American, and that is what makes it so suspect given this town, Montalcino, is not a tourist location. The Democrats can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t afford for the Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s first foreign trip to be a success, so they dispatched the Obamas to Italy. There are no coincidences in the high-stakes game of politics. ‚ÄoeOn Friday, the former president and first lady touched down at Grosseto Air Base in Tuscany, their private jet accompanied by six Eurofighter Fourth Wing jets. The Obamas, who have been on multiple vacations since leaving the White House in January, will reportedly visit Florence and Siena during their vacation. They are expected to fly out on May 25,‚Äù reports Daily Mail. However, Michelle made the mistake of wearing a shabby looking outfit, and then, some paparazzi, not in on her game, caught her downing a helping of gelato, Italian ice cream, while her Secret Service looked on, wishing he had some. This, in contrast to Melania‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s warm reception in Saudi Arabia, didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t play well for Michelle, who is trying to disrupt Melania‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s big trip, but that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not all. ‚ÄoeFirst Lady Melania Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fashion choices got rave reviews in local Saudi Arabian press Sunday, despite forgoing the customary headscarf,‚Äù reports CNN. The following tweet says it all, showing Melania, so far, is doing really well, despite Michelle trying to grab the headlines in Italy. . praised in Saudi news for her "classy and conservative" look (sans headscarf) cc: ‚Ä" Elizabeth Landers () May 21, 2017 The Trumps will be in Italy on May 24th, and the Obamas are booked to be traveling in Italy for the next six days. So, what do the Obamas and their funders hope to accomplish? They hope to undermine the Trumps‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> trip in Italy, clearly. They hope for a misstep by Trump and then cameras will turn to Barack and Michelle, who will just happen to be there. The Democrats are desperate to turn the news cycle back to the Trump-Russia connection. This trip has already changed the news cycle, with Donald and Melania having been a huge success. This is no conspiracy theory about the Obamas being on hand just to undermine the Trumps. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s how the game of politics is played. So, look for some upset by the nutjobs on the left, especially in Italy. Politics is a well-oiled game at this level. Every move on the chessboard is weighed and measured, and what may seem like a coincidence is really a well thought out opportunity waiting to happen. The Democrats are panicking that Trump has done it again; he has stopped the media‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s talking points against him with this brilliant trip aboard. Barack and Michelle are poised to pounce in Italy, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll stick with President Trump and First Lady who are blazing a trail, making America respected and loved around the world, once again.
