Shocking information about Barack Obama is coming to light after court officials caught him red-handed hiding his dirty White House secrets. What compounds the seriousness is that the place he was caught hiding these dirty secrets is one huge lie, which proves he is trying to avoid prosecution. President Donald Trump is ready to pounce on these secrets, which show how Obama illegally set him up. This will blow your mind. Shocking information from the National Security Council has just come to light. We all remember Susan Rice, who served as Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s National Security Adviser, and most recently, she has been under scrutiny for refusing to testify in front of the Senate Intel Hearings on Trump and Russia. The White House Counsel‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s office identified Rice as the person who had requested the unmasking of American citizens, after examining her log requests. Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s name is among those who were illegally targeted for surveillance. Now, we know why Rice refused to testify. She was biding her time, waiting for the incriminating documents to be moved. Breitbart reports, ‚ÄoeThe National Security Council cannot hand over records relating to former National Security Adviser Susan Rice‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s surveillance of Americans because they have been moved to the Obama presidential library and may be sealed for as many as five years, conservative watchdog Judicial Watch announced Monday.‚Äù Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s break this down. We have Barack Obama, who was illegally ‚Äoewiretapping‚Äù Donald Trump starting in June-July 2016. Susan Rice, as his NSA Adviser, obtained the secret FISA court warrants to wiretap Trump, and then, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the National Security Administration, which has now moved those records to the Obama Library. The paper trail proving that Obama and Rice illegally surveilled Trump has mysteriously been moved to the Obama Library, which is not even constructed yet in Chicago. Now, no one can see those documents for five years. You might be thinking this is a bad joke or that this is unconfirmed information. No, this has been verified by court officials and lawyers at Judicial Watch, who requested all documents pertaining to Susan Rice‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s activities. ‚ÄoeThe NSC informed Judicial Watch in a letter dated May 23 that materials related to Rice‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s requests to know the identities of Americans swept up in surveillance of foreign targets, including any Trump campaign or transition officials, have been moved to the library,‚Äù reports Breitbart. Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presidential library is five years away from being completed, so there is no library. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a huge construction site on the south side of Chicago. USA Today reports, ‚ÄoeConstruction of the Obama presidential library and museum is expected to be completed by 2021.‚Äù So, where are these documents which incriminate Obama and Rice? That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the million dollar question, and President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s highly competent legal team is most certainly taking action to uncover their location. Obama is no longer president, so he cannot just move government documents to a fake library that doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exist, not to mention how desperate he must be to do something like this that makes him look 100% guilty. Tom Fitton, attorney at Judicial Watch, is livid. He reported, ‚ÄoeProsecutors, Congress, and the public will want to know when the National Security Council shipped off the records about potential intelligence abuses by the Susan Rice and others in the Obama White House to the memory hole of the Obama Presidential Library. We are considering our legal options but we hope that the Special Counsel and Congress also consider their options and get these records.‚Äù Those records have Susan Rice taking orders from Barack Obama to illegally surveil Trump Tower, Donald Trump, and his campaign, that much is crystal clear. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to rip apart the Democrats fake news and innuendo, saying Trump did something illegal. Barack Obama, Susan ‚ÄoeBenghazi‚Äù Rice, Hillary Clinton, Loretta Lynch, and James Comey are the criminals, and Americans are fed-up with this game playing and never ending hearings into the wrong people. We demand justice. This is the United States of America, where no one is above the law.
