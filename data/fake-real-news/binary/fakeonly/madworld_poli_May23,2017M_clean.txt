Graduates from Notre Dame turned their backs on Vice President Mike Pence, walking out of the commencement ceremony before he could even begin his speech. After garnering quite a bit of attention for disrespecting Pence, two students appeared on CNN, where the host got to the bottom of their little temper tantrum. The pair accidentally slipped up, revealing the real reason behind the stunt, and it could end up costing them big time. The opportunity to have the Vice President of the United States speak at your graduation is an immense privilege, but many of the entitled little brats who shelled out an ungodly amount of money to be educated at Notre Dame didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t appear to think so. By walking out of their own graduation, they proved nothing more than their disdain for the American values which have provided them with so much. Appearing on CNN, students Luis Miranda and Aniela Tyksinski tried to defend their actions, but it backfired tremendously. ‚ÄoeFor us, we felt the need to walk out, because we wanted to stand here to protect human dignity, we wanted to have solidarity with those that are the most vulnerable of us, and also to seek justice for them,‚Äù said Luis. ‚ÄoeWe essentially have classmates, family members, and friends, who were either with us, sitting down there, or also in the stands, who have been specifically targeted by the policies of Mike Pence, either as a governor or as a president, directly,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s something that is part of their everyday lived experiences. And we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re talking about classmates who are from the LGBT+ community, for which Mike Pence has sought to go away with civil right protections,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄoeIn my case, part of my family is undocumented, and so it just didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t feel appropriate and we wanted to stand with them and for them.‚Äù Of course, admitting that members of your family are in the United States illegally is an excellent way to get them deported. But, Aniela went on to do the same thing. ‚ÄoePersonally, I have many loved ones, family and friends, and my partner, who are undocumented, so I was really walking out with them in mind,‚Äù she said, according to The Blaze. ‚ÄoeThat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really what I had in my heart as I was walking out.‚Äù As usual, these whiny activists are a bit short in the intelligence department, despite their rather expensive education. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be lucky if ICE doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t show up to haul their loved ones south of the border. In 2017, college graduates are mostly worthless. In fact, employers are almost better off hiring young people who haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t attended college and been indoctrinated for four years. Free speech is a right guaranteed to all Americans, even Mike Pence. If you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to make it in the real world, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to hear things you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like every once in awhile, but part of being an adult means dealing with different opinions, something these Notre Dame graduates apparently cannot do.
