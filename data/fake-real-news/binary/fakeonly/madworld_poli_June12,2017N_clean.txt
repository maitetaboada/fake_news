Ivanka Trump kicked off the week by sitting down with the hosts of ‚ÄoeFox & Friends‚Äù for an interview. Although the sit-down was meant as an opportunity for her to praise her father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s administration and all of the accomplishments achieved thus far, things quickly took a turn in another direction. After being asked one blunt question, she made a shocking but honest admission. Host Brian Kilmeade asked Ivanka if her new role as President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s assistant was harder than she thought it would be. Of course, he likely expected her response to be something along the lines of ‚Äoeabsolutely not,‚Äù but instead, she caught everyone off guard when she allowed herself to be vulnerable, admitting the truth. ‚ÄoeIt is hard. And there is a level of viciousness that I was not expecting,‚Äù said Ivanka, according to Daily Mail. ‚ÄoeI was not expecting the intensity of this experience, but this isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t supposed to be easy. My father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s administration intends to be transformative, and we want to do big, bold things. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re looking to change the status quo.‚Äù ‚ÄoeI didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expect it to be easy. I think some of the distractions and some of the ferocity I was a little blind-sided by on a personal level,‚Äù Ivanka explained. Sadly, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right, and it speaks volumes to the state of affairs in our nation. The left has been vicious as her critics, and the liberal goons will undoubtedly stop at nothing to defame the Trumps anyway they can. We all know that Ivanka is a strong woman. Not only is she the daughter of the President of the United States, but she has proven that she works hard to get things done. Along with that, she has learned how to deal with critics, even if they do get under her skin from time to time. In fact, her solution to the people who ‚Äoeblind-side‚Äù her is simple. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m trying to keep my head down, not listen to the noise, and just work really hard to make a positive impact in the lives of many people,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄoeI mean, if you want to, at the end of the day, if you want to think about difficult, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the factory worker who has been laid off. Difficult is, you know, the mother who has lost a child to opioid abuse.‚Äù She managed to turn the conversation around from focusing on her difficulties and challenges to those faced by the average American. Eventually, she went on to admit that ‚Äoethis experience has been surreal.‚Äù Although most liberals would deny it, if President Donald Trump did anything right, it was putting Ivanka in the spotlight. Not only is she classy, confident, and gorgeous, but she has effectively been able to show the world that her father is a strong figure, who raised a strong woman, and he isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the ‚Äoebad guy‚Äù that the mainstream media would have you believe him to be. Instead, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s helped him prove that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly what America has needed for nearly a decade, a president who cares about his country and the American people.
