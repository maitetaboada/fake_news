After agreeing to be a guest on The View, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was beyond baffled when the hosts tried to get him to say that President Donald Trump should be impeached. However, the women at the table would be left speechless after the man put them in their place ‚Ä" and all it took was just two words. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no arguing that the heavily liberal-leaning show and its hosts are extremely biased. In fact, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s such a propaganda machine for the left that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s embarrassing that some people actually call it a ‚Äoenews show‚Äù and turn to the liberal whiners to keep up on current events. With the likes of Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar leading the way, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s safe to say that not too many people with an ounce of common sense really take them too seriously. Unfortunately for the few who do, they were in for a rude awakening after the hosts asked Rumsfeld to come on the show for a few questions. As is usually the case, the conversation quickly turned to the leftist bashing of President Trump, but they made the sad mistake of trying to get Rumsfeld to join them. ‚ÄoeWell, he [Donald Trump] lost by more than three million votes in the popular vote. He won the electoral vote,‚Äù Behar explained to the former Secretary of Defense, thinking she was quite clever, but he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d soon make her regret opening her mouth. As Daily Caller reports, Rumsfeld dropped the hammer on the ignorant hosts, and it only took him two words to prove his point. ‚ÄoeWhat counts?‚Äù he rhetorically asked in response to Behar‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s comments about the popular and electoral votes. ‚ÄoeWell the electoral vote counts,‚Äù Behar answered. ‚ÄoeI thought so,‚Äù Rumsfeld said with a look of satisfaction. As if that wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t enough of a public spanking for the group, the clueless morons continued to try to bury Trump ‚Ä" but once again, they would fail. This time, co-host Sunny Hostin joined Behar in comparing the investigation into alleged ties between Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 2016 campaign and Russia with Watergate. Too bad for them, their pathetic attempt would soon go down in flames. ‚ÄoeI think suggesting that we are at a point that approximates Watergate, I think is a stretch,‚Äù Rumsfeld shot back. ‚ÄoeWhy do you want to engage in hypotheticals? This man was elected President of the United States.‚Äù The beatings didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop either as Rumsfeld just kept embarrassing them time after time. ‚ÄoeThere is an investigation on the subject you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve cited,‚Äù he later added. ‚ÄoeWhich is perfectly appropriate. Nothing has been concluded. I have a sense you might be jumping to conclusions.‚Äù Now, we all know how smug, arrogant, and belligerent the women on The View can be, but Rumsfeld did something that not too many people have done in the past ‚Ä" beat them at their own game. When the dust settled, all the hosts could do was stutter on their own words as they were faced with the truth. It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take a genius to see that there is no proof of anything that the hosts of The View like to attack Trump over. Instead, they would rather deal in hypothetical ‚Äoewhat ifs‚Äù as if they were fact ‚Ä" and they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not. Faced with this reality, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re left speechless ‚Ä" and one can only hope that is a more frequent occurrence during the coming days.
