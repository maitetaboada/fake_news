A shocking tidbit about Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time at Harvard has just been uncovered, and his huge man-crush on Donald Trump has been exposed. This explosive information was tightly under wraps during the 2016 campaign for fear it would have damaged Hillary Clinton. But make no mistake, this is not a rumor. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s actually proven by Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own words that he wrote down and can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t deny. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Barack Obama is taking a lot of heat for the words he wrote while at Harvard, between 1988-91. Obama wrote a book titled, ‚ÄoeTransformative Politics‚Äù or ‚ÄoePromises of Democracy: Hopeful Critiques of American Ideology,‚Äù where he wrote, ‚ÄoeI may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make it, my children will.‚Äù Obama sees Trump as an iconic American, a man that he wants to be. Taking into consideration that Donald Trump is a white man, Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s man-crush is a pretty big revelation. Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own words turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, which describes why, ultimately, his presidency is rejected in favor of Donald Trump. The total excerpt reads, ‚Äoe[Americans have] a continuing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and mobility, values that extend far beyond the issue of race in the American mind. The depth of this commitment may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American ‚Ä" I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make it, my children will.‚Äù Here, Obama is writing about mobility, about being an American, and saying that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s our unique individual freedoms that supersede any issues with race. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s saying that no matter who you are or what skin color you have, in America, we all have an equal chance to become Donald Trump. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s explosive writing coming from Barack Obama. These are conservative values and go against everything the Black Lives Matter thugs represent. Obama is also saying Trump is the epitome of the American dream, as the guy that made it in America with hard work. This flies in the face of what the Clinton campaign was saying. They wanted everyone to believe Trump was handed everything, but Obama says, no, he made it on his own. Daily Wire weighed in on Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s writings about Trump, saying, ‚ÄoeSo there you have it, straight from the pen of Obama: the ultimate vision of true success ‚Ä" at least for naively optimistic Americans ‚Ä" is to be the next Trump. The only surprising thing about the story so far is that Trump hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t tweeted it out, yet.‚Äù Author David Garrow, a well-known researcher, found Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Harvard book that had not been previously discovered and included it in his new 1,400-page book called ‚ÄoeRising Star: The Making of Barack Obama.‚Äù This book is being lauded as the most authoritative biography of Obama, which has also uncovered many of his strange ‚Äoequirks.‚Äù Other tidbits include, ‚ÄoeObama broke up with the half-white, half-Asian woman to whom he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d proposed because he feared it might damage his racial political credentials, and that Obama once ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>considered gayness‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> but decided hetero relationships were preferable because they were ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>more challenging and demanding,‚Äù‚Ä<sup>~</sup> reports Daily Wire. This is turning out to be one of the most embarrassing revelations to come out of the Obama camp, especially in light of their campaign to ‚Äoeresist‚Äù everything President Donald Trump does. The fact is, Barack Obama makes the case why Americans rejected him in favor the man he aspired to be, the man he said he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d like his kids to be. Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own words came back to haunt him, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s safe to say, he fell short of his own aspirations. He is no Donald Trump, and he never will be.
