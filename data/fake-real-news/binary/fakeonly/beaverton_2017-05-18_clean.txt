TORONTO ‚Ä" The Beaverton, Canada‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hit satirical website turned television show is following through on the commitment it made to always be at the forefront of things that peaked 4-5 years ago, by launching a brand new podcast network. ‚ÄoeAs everyone in 2011 knows, podcasts are the wave of the future,‚Äù said editor-in-chief Luke Gordon Field. ‚ÄoeAnd that is why we are so delighted to jump on board this exciting and widely saturated market.‚Äù The network will launch with four brand new shows, all of which would have been pretty groundbreaking if we didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t live in an age when every website, tv show and open mic comedian already has a podcast. They include: THE BEAVERTON WEEKLY REPORT: Every week Beaverton editor-in-chief Luke Gordon Field assembles some of the country‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s best comedians and writers to talk, mock and riff their way through the news of the week. Then he puts their knowledge to the test in a very important quiz where the winner gets absolute nothing. Part panel show, part interview, the Beaverton Weekly Report is an hilarious look at what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going on in the world around us.
