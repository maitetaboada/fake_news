For some reason, famed celebrities seem to think they know more than the American people, and Katy Perry most recently decided to prove just that. Unfortunately for her, after suggesting that ‚Äoeopen borders‚Äù is the best way to end terrorism, things miraculously blew up in her face ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about the time a Navy SEAL put her in her place with just 3 brutally honest words. The world and most of all England is still mourning after a Muslim man killed 22 people and injured 119 more in a Manchester bombing. Now, some liberals have decided to use the opportunity to offer their opinion where it isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t needed, wanted, or even helpful in the slightest. In fact, Katy Perry made an absolute fool of herself by offering her two cents while apparently knowing nothing about the situation. Sadly, celebrities still don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see that they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re perhaps the most out-of-touch group when it comes to everyday people: ‚ÄoeNo barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just coexist,‚Äù Perry said on the Elvis Duran Show Tuesday. ‚ÄoeThe greatest thing we can do now is just, like, unite as people, as, like, fanbases‚Ä¶all of it,‚Äù she offered. ‚ÄoeCause, like, as much as, like, whatever we say behind people‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s backs, cause the internet can be a little bit ruthless as far as fanbases go, but I think that the greatest thing we can do is just unite and love one another.‚Äù [Source: Daily Caller] Too bad for her, it seems that her ‚Äoejust love everyone‚Äù suggestion came at a cost ‚Ä" and it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t pretty. According to Daily Caller, Former Navy SEAL Carl Higbie was speaking with Fox News host Shannon Bream, where he had some pretty harsh words for the clueless celebrity. ‚ÄoeIf you come to America, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re American and nothing else ‚Ä¶ but we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have people who respect the culture of the United States of America,‚Äù he began. ‚ÄoeYou have people like Katy Perry‚Ä¶this woman has said, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>oh we need to give them hugs, hug it out.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>‚Äù Although Higbie was mocking at first, he then decided to drop a brutal 3-word bomb on Perry‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s head that would put her in her place for good. ‚ÄoeGo to hell, Katy Perry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄoeHold one of your concerts in Syria and see how that goes.‚Äù Although he went on to refer to Perry‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s statements as ‚Äoebenign,‚Äù he added that ‚Äoe[celebrities] don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand any of this and they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to understand, too. And that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m so strong against these celebrities who want to speak out.‚Äù Being nice is one thing, but putting political correctness above the lives of people is an entirely different monster. The fact of the matter here is that the Muslim ideology can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ‚Äoecoexist‚Äù as their holy text demands they Jihad their way to world domination. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the entire point of Islam: Kill until all that remains if for Allah. Celebrities do have a certain amount of influence on the public, given their popularity. However, that doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mean that what they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re saying is right or that they even know what they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re talking about when they speak on matters like this. When it comes down to it, celebrities need to close their fat traps and only open them when it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to do their job ‚Ä" entertain.
