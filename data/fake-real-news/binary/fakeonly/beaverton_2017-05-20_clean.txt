NEW YORK ‚Ä" In what is already being hailed as a novel and innovative attempt to reach out to America‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s crucial Evangelical consumer base, PepsiCo subsidiary Mountain Dew has announced a new promotional contest that asks consumers what Dew would have been done by their Lord and saviour Jesus Christ. The three contestant flavours, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Mountain Dew: Dew Testament‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Mountain Dew: Sermon on the Mountain Dew‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, and ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Mountain Dew: Book of Code Red-velations‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> are available for a limited run in select stores, and customers are encouraged to vote for their favourite online or through social media. A company spokesperson claimed the campaign was meant to target ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Dudes who don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have time to be dead for three days‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Only the most radical Christians‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. The beverage company‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s distinctive ads feature a sweatband and sunglasses-clad Jesus at a reenactment of the iconic Last Supper. ‚ÄoeThis is my body, given for you; this is my blood, which is poured out for you; and this‚Ä¶ is how I dew,‚Äù says Jesus, before grinding down the length of the table on a crucifix-shaped skateboard to thumping house music and twerking apostles. ‚ÄoeDo this Dew‚Ä¶ in remembrance of me.‚Äù At press time, the Vatican had issued a statement claiming that the campaign was ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Only slightly more blasphemous than ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>PuppyMonkeyBaby.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Tags: blood, Evangelical, Jesus, Mountain Dew, radical, vatican
