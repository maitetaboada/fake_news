The liberal wife of Franceâ€<sup>TM</sup>s new president was no match for our glamorous First Lady when the pair met in Brussels on Thursday. Melania Trump met Brigitte Macron while touring the Magritte Museum, where she found the most perfect and effortless way to upstage her. Melania and Brigitte were joined by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michelâ€<sup>TM</sup>s partner, Amelie Derbaudrenghien, and NATO chief Jens Stoltenbergâ€<sup>TM</sup>s wife, Ingrid Schulerud, among others, as they toured the museum. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump met with Franceâ€<sup>TM</sup>s new president, Emmanuel Macron, ahead of a NATO summit in Brussels, according to Fox News. Then, the First Lady did a quick change before meeting Queen Mathilde of Belgium at the Royal Castle of Laeken on Thursday evening. Brigitte did not change, a decision she would likely regret, as all eyes were on Melania, who donned a stunning off-the-shoulder dress. Earlier in the day, the 47-year-old donned a leather skirt suit by Belgian designer Maison Ullens and Manolo Blahnik snakeskin heels to visit to a childrenâ€<sup>TM</sup>s hospital before meeting a group of NATO spouses, including French First Lady Brigitte Macron, to tour the Magritte Museum in Brussels. And while Brigitte, 64, and a few of the other women opted to leave on what they wore to the museum, Melania slipped on an off-the-shoulder, black lace gown and scrappy stiletto sandals before rejoining the rest of the group at the royal residence.

To be fair, Melania Trump clearly was not trying to upstage anyone, but when youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re that beautiful, it just comes with the territory. She is quickly becoming the most fashionable First Lady in our nationâ€<sup>TM</sup>s history, which is utterly refreshing following eight years of Michelle Obamaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s lack of class and style.
