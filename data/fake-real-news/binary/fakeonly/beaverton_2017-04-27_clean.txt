OTTAWA ‚Ä" Minister of Science Kirsty Duncan has burst out of a time machine on June 24, 1867, just in time to prevent a younger version of herself from murdering Father of Confederation John A. Macdonald. ‚ÄoeDon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do it, Kirst,‚Äù said the older Duncan, raising both hands as the younger Duncan whirled to point the gun at her. ‚ÄoeI know it might make sense to you now, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve seen things you haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t.‚Äù ‚ÄoeAlso, that shirt will go out of style sooner than you think.‚Äù Sources report that young Duncan, flustered and distressed, shouted, ‚ÄoeNo, I have to!‚Äù and aimed her gun at Macdonald, who was drafting a speech for July 1st in his study. At this, older Duncan allegedly tackled younger Duncan to the ground and disarmed her. ‚ÄoeTrust‚Ä¶ me‚Ä¶ it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s better‚Ä¶ this‚Ä¶ way,‚Äù said older Duncan, struggling to bind the hands of an opponent who knew all of her moves. Duncan reportedly set forth on her latest journey through spacetime when she noticed a parliamentary painting in which Macdonald‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face had almost completely faded. While ultimately successful, the mission was briefly jeopardized when Duncan was unable to get her time machine, a decommissioned TTC streetcar, to the 20 km/h required to activate the flux capacitor. Since Duncan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s return to the 21st century, Macdonald‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s journals make mention of a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>trolley of some sort‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>two strange women who looked like twins‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, a vision Macdonald ultimately attributed ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>to the brandy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. This revelation helped corroborate Duncan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s testimony, which critics had claimed was ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>riddled with paradoxes‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, specifically that Macdonald is now also the son of Confederation. Although Canada still exists in Duncan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s timeline, it remains unclear why an elderly, cybernetic Kirsten Duncan also arrived in 1867, just moments after the departure of her younger selves, shouting something about ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>closing a loop‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>rogue time cop John Diefenbaker‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>.
