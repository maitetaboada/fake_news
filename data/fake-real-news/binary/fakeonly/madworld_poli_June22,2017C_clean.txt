Nancy Pelosi looks like she is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and she has every reason to be losing her mind. Democrats spent millions of dollars on one Congressional race in Georgia, and their candidate, Jon Ossoff, was trounced by Republican Karen Handel. Now, Pelosi just got some devastating news, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what all patriots have been waiting for. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to love this. It looks like curtains for Nancy Pelosi. Democrats are openly calling for her to resign, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only a matter of time. Washington, D.C. insiders say we will be celebrating Nancy packing her bags for good, very soon. For all intents and purposes, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s already history, as the overwhelming sentiments displayed is not something she can recover from. Even CNN is throwing Nancy under the bus, giving those Democrats who are calling for her to resign important air time. ‚ÄoeHouse Democrats are publicly saying it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to step aside as the face of the party ahead of the 2018 midterms following Tuesday night‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disappointing loss in a special election for a Georgia House seat,‚Äù reports CNN. Pelosi, who will turn seventy-eight, will not just resign her leadership role even though she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s too old and mentally scattered to go on and the calls for her resignation are only increasing. ‚ÄoeWe need leadership change,‚Äù New York Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice told CNN outside the House chamber. ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for Nancy Pelosi to go, and the entire leadership team.‚Äù Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton echoed Rice‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s complaints in an interview with CNN‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Jake Tapper. ‚ÄoeThis is certainly something that we have to discuss because it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s clear that, I think, across the board in the Democratic Party we need new leadership. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for a new generation of leadership in the party.‚Äù She has to go. Her pressers are useless. She spouts the same rhetoric and inspires no one. She can't stop the GOP health plan. ‚Ä" Gene McLaughlin () June 22, 2017 Step down NOW! You are an embarassment to the party! ‚Ä" Big D. () June 22, 2017 Oh boy, these are bombshell developments, and social media is being brutal to poor ole Botox Nan. The writing is on the wall, and it looks like Pelosi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s swan song was not a fat lady singing, but U2‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Bono. Instead of worrying about the Georgia election, Nancy was spotted at the Washington, D.C., U2 concert in $1500 seats. Lead singer Bono was obliged to give her a ‚Äoeshout-out.‚Äù ‚ÄoeJust as the California Dem was getting blamed for being a drag on the Democratic candidate in Georgia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s special election, Pelosi was enjoying the show from the stands. Sporting a light blue linen pantsuit and a blue sweater, Pelosi could have been just any (albeit well-dressed) ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Joshua Tree‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> fan ‚Ä" but the U2 lead singer gave her a shout out,‚Äù reported The Washington Post. That concert is something that is coming back to haunt her now. Pelosi was partying with Bono while her beloved Democratic Party was getting zilch for their multi-million dollar investment in Jon Ossoff. Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just say the concert was the cherry on top that tipped Democrats to turn on the Minority Leader. Oh, what will we do without Nancy Pelosi? That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the question. Pelosi was political Ebola for anyone who used her name in a Congressional race in 2017, six races the Democrats lost. So, as painful as this is to say, if she somehow eeks out some way for her to stay, that would be a good thing for the GOP-Trump candidates, but that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not likely. So, get ready for another Democrat biting the dust thanks to the ‚ÄoePresident Trump affect‚Äù ‚Ä" she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be stepping down within a few days. Goodbye and good riddance.
