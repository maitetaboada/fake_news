VANCOUVER ‚Ä" A BC Conservative Party candidate decided to reach out to electors in the hotly contested Vancouver-Point Grey Riding by canvassing Wreck Beach, a popular destination for nudists. Richard Potter strolled down the beach shaking hands and keeping his eyes at head level. ‚ÄoeOur plan for British Columbia is simple: more jobs, more infrastructure, and more nipples‚Ä¶I mean more accountability,‚Äù explained the visibly uncomfortable candidate averting his eyes. Lora Burton, Potter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign manager, tried to coach her candidate to stay on message and to stop staring before the quick stop. ‚ÄoeThe naturist demographic is a key swing vote in the riding,‚Äù said Burton. ‚ÄoeI just told him not to get the jitters and just picture everyone wearing clothes.‚Äù Tags: BC Election 2017, Wreck Beach
