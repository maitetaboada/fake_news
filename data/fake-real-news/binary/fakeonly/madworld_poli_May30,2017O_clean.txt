A disturbing display targeting Americans outside a bar in Europe recently went viral after it left onlookers utterly disgusted on Memorial Day. However, things would soon take a turn when a restaurant in Kansas got a chance to get the perfect revenge with a badass sign of their own. The initial sign was posted outside of what appears to be a bar somewhere in Europe. As fate would have it, Political Scientist Ian Bremmer was passing by and decided to take a quick picture of it before sharing it on social media, where it gained a lot of attention, and when you read it, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s easy to see why. Europe. OK, we deserve that. ‚Ä" ian bremmer () May 29, 2017 As seen in the image, the disturbing display that was placed outside and captured on Memorial Day simply read, ‚ÄoeAll Americans must be accompanied by an adult,‚Äù Twitchy reports. Even worse was the fact that Bremmer agreed with the sign writing, ‚ÄoeEurope. OK, we deserve that,‚Äù beneath the picture. Of course, outrage pertaining to the sign was quick and fierce, especially considering it was put on display during a day marked for the remembrance of all fallen soldiers. As we all know, thousands of Americans died over the course of two world wars as we pitched in to help defeat the evil forces trying to take over Europe: On Memorial Day, we remember the countless thousands of Americans who died in order to save Europe. D ‚Ä" Jeffrey Goldberg () May 30, 2017 "Americans are unwelcome dolts and also they're insufficiently willing to go to war on my behalf" ‚Ä" yep, sounds like Europe to me. ‚Ä" Seth Mandel () May 29, 2017 The ghosts of all those who died liberating that second rate Continent will suffice d ‚Ä" Jim Hanson () May 30, 2017 Unfortunately for the morons who actually thought this was a good idea at the time, the worst was yet to come as America got a chance to respond. Mayberry‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s, a restaurant in Washington, Kansas, put up a badass sign of their own, getting the perfect revenge on the American-hating Europeans. Breitbart reports that the sign started off by saying, ‚ÄoeWe have 619,300 reasons to be closed Monday!‚Äù before revealing the number of those who died fighting in World War I, World War II, and the Korean, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars, KSDK reported. (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); One of the coolest signs I have come across. Well done Mayberry's in Washington KS. Posted by Brandon Lee on Thursday, May 25, 2017 ‚ÄoePeople talk about Memorial Day being the start of summer and that sort of thing,‚Äù said Kelly Ray, the restaurant‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s manager and chef. ‚ÄoeBut what it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really about is those people who died. I hope people think about them.‚Äù There really isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t anything we can do to show the actual amount of gratitude we have for those who made the ultimate sacrifice. The rest of the world may think it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s their right to poke fun at America, but when it comes down to it, they would be nothing without us. What they should be doing, especially on a day like Memorial Day, is thanking us and those who died for their freedom. You better make sure that when you decided to open your fat trap that you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re saying the right thing because you could end up paying for it. As for this European bar, well, to say they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been embarrassed on an international scale would be putting things lightly. In fact, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s safe to say that their sign is proof enough of their own stupidity.
