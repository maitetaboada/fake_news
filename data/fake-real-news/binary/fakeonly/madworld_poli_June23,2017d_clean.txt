James Comey is coming under fire after he was spotted trying to slip into one very prominent location unnoticed where President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s biggest enemies can be found. Not only that, but this secret meeting can be very incriminating for Comey, who admitted under oath to leaking information to the media. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be shocked at Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s big mistake as he is clearly in panic mode as he gets caught red-handed. Just hours after President Trump admitted that he did not record any of his conversations with James Comey, the former FBI Director was spotted entering The New York Times office building in Times Square, NYC. As Daily Mail notes, ‚ÄoeComey confessed to being the source of a leak to the Times about private, unorthodox meeting he had with the president before he was fired in June.‚Äù Comey kept his sunglasses on and his gaze forward as he marched through the front entrance of the Eighth Avenue office building which houses the publication. He was accompanied by his wife Patrice Failor who also wore sunglasses while entering the building. Unmistakable as he towered over the crowds in a crisp navy suit and tie on one of the warmest days of the year, Comey, who is 6‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>8‚Ä≥ tall, drew second glances from some stunned passersby. He spent almost three hours inside before emerging, having removed his sunglasses, to hail a cab. Of course, The New York Times denies Comey was there to meet them exclusively, and obviously, Comey had a cover story explaining his presence at the Times. One of the biggest thorns in Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s side, a NY Times reporter named Maggie Haberman, who is responsible for publishing multiple anti-Trump articles citing ‚Äoeanonymous sources,‚Äù tweeted out a pic of Comey. Just how did Maggie Haberman get the photo? It was not published anywhere else on social media, and it proves nothing about what Comey did during his three-hour visit. Nice try, but patriots aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t being fooled by the NY Times anymore. Pic from Covington & Burling event, from person close to Comey 2 ‚Ä" Maggie Haberman () June 23, 2017 Maggie Haberman and her partner at work, Glenn Thrush, were outed by WikiLeaks for colluding with the Hillary Clinton campaign. They sent articles for John Podesta to ‚Äoepre-approve‚Äù before they published them. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not journalism, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s propaganda and colluding with a campaign. Thrush wrote to John Podesta in April 2015, ‚ÄoeNo worries Because I have become a hack I will send u the whole section that pertains to u. (sic) Please don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t share or tell anyone I did this Tell me if I f*cked up anything.‚Äù So, we can expect a breaking story by Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush in the next few days on that rat James Comey who can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem to stop leaking to the press. Trump said, ‚ÄoeI believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very cowardly!‚Äù He went on to allude that there was more than one leak. James Comey and his best buddy Robert Mueller are in cahoots to do as much damage as possible to President Donald Trump. Comey, a drama queen, seeks the limelight and is like a jilted lover scorned. He should be under investigation, not Trump. Let him leak to his pets at the NY Times. They have been utterly disgraced as hacks, and since these traitors go against the president, they go against the best interest of the United States. For that very reason, Americans will never trust anything they say.
