While in Israel, President Donald Trump and Melania Trump were able to meet with a slew of foreign dignitaries and heads of state. However, the most meaningful visit for Melania might have been her meeting with the First Lady of Israel as Mrs. Trump was surprised with quite an incredibly unique gift ‚Ä" and people have been left shocked to learn the much deeper meaning behind it. As we all know, the Trump family was once beloved by many Americans on both sides of the political aisle but that has changed during recent days when a large portion of the country turned on the family since their transition into politics. With the left launching endless attacks, it has likely had a negative effect emotionally on all of them to some degree. Of course, that is even more likely the case for the Trumps‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> son, Barron, who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just a young boy and not used to the spotlight. Suffering ridicule since the day his father won the election, it goes without saying that the abuse and bullying he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s received from even famous people like Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fair, dignified, or adult-like in the slightest. Fortunately, not everyone in the world is as vile as some of those on the left who would mercilessly target a child ‚Ä" and the First Lady of Israel, Nechama Rivlin, most recently proved just that. Captured in a series of photos, the woman sat down with Melania and gifted her with something that went so much further than face value. As can be seen, Mrs. Rivlin handed Melania a stack of three books that turned out to actually be intended for her and Barron to share and enjoy together. The gift was actually a book called ‚ÄoeThe Hug‚Äù that she got in three different languages, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the content of the story that really matters. ‚ÄoeAccording to descriptions, the book illustrates a mother and son, alone on a walk. Her boy is named Ben,‚Äù IJ Review reports. ‚ÄoeThe son is worried that he is alone in the world because he is ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>special,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> but his mother reassures him with a hug.‚Äù A review from the Jewish Book Council goes on to explain: Poetically translated from the original Hebrew, we follow young Ben and his mother as they walk through a field one afternoon talking about what makes Ben so very special. If you are unique and special, are you all alone in the world, asks Ben, with a quiet but deep concern. But his mother knows, as mothers often do, how to reassure her child that being one of a kind need never mean being all on your own. Explaining the deeper, and more thought out, meaning behind the gift, the Israeli First Lady went on to describe in a Facebook post, ‚ÄoeIt was important for me to give the Barron, who remained at home and is only 11 years old, a souvenir from his parents‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> visit to Israel.‚Äù Of course, she continued by saying Melania was ‚Äoemoved‚Äù and ‚Äoeimmediately understood‚Äù that the book was intended for her and Barron. Although the Trump family has suffered one disgusting and disturbing attack after another since moving into the White House, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s clear to see that not everyone is so hostile towards the family. In fact, when it comes down to it, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s important ‚Ä" most of all ‚Ä" to see the Trumps for what they are; human beings. No one wants to have their family disrespected, but the left doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem to care when it comes to the families of those they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t agree with. However, there will always be strong and powerful people all around the world to show us what true dignity looks like ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly what the First Lady of Israel did here with such an incredibly well thought out gift.
