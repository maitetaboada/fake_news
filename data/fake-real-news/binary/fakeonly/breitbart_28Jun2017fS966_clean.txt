Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the ranking Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Politico: ‚ÄoeWe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got another Scalia.‚Äù She was referring to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a hero to conservatives and a leading light of the originalist school of jurisprudence, who passed away last year and whose seat Gorsuch has just filled. Politico elaborates: Feinstein told POLITICO she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d looked at Gorsuch‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s early rulings and saw no sign of moderation from conservative orthodoxy. ‚ÄoeRight down the line. Everything ‚Ä" everything,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m surprised that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s so comprehensive.‚Äù Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut ‚Ä" a former Supreme Court clerk ‚Ä" said Gorsuch‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s early record on the court is in tension with the humble and evenhanded approach he touted during his confirmation hearings in March. ‚ÄoeIn a way, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m surprised that he hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t demonstrated more independence. I am surprised because in his demeanor and his tone he really made a huge effort to show his openness ‚Ä" which some of us thought might be more an act than it was a real persona,‚Äù Blumenthal said, before adding: ‚ÄoeSo far, I have to say, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m disappointed.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄoeOn the travel ban, I think he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fulfilling the worst expectations so far of his opponents and probably the best hopes of his supporters,‚Äù Blumenthal said. Politico adds that Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) called Gorsuch ‚Äoethe tool of the creepy billionaire coalition.‚Äù Meanwhile, according to Politico, Republicans were exultant, with Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) calling Gorsuch ‚Äoeawesome,‚Äù and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) declaring Gorsuch was ‚Äoeexactly what we hoped for and expected.‚Äù In general, the pattern is otherwise: judges with conservative track records frequently become more liberal after being nominated, thanks to pressure from the media, the liberal legal fraternity, and their colleagues on the bench.
