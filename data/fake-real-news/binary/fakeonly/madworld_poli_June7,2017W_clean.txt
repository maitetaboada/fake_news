National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers just wrecked President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s liberal enemies with 9 words as he sat before the Senate Intelligence Committee to answer one specific question. Devastating would be the best way to describe what the NSA Director just did in this epic footage that is on its way to breaking the internet. According to The Gateway Pundit, Admiral Rogers testified before the Senate Intel Committee on Thursday, June 7, 2017. As the Senate Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-VA) attempted to squeeze some kind of confession out of Rogers on Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s supposed obstruction accusations, the NSA chief came up with a big slap-in-the-face for Senator Warner and the left as a whole. Watch as he puts this corrupt Democrat in his place with 9 words. Senator Warner starts by asking, ‚ÄoeIn your experience, would it be in any way typical for a president to ask questions or bring up an ongoing FBI investigation? Particularly if that investigation concerns associates and individuals that might be associated with the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign or his activities?‚Äù Admiral Rogers doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t waste any time in cutting Warner at the knees, quickly responding, ‚ÄoeSo, today I am not going to talk about theoreticals. I am not going to discuss the specifics of any interaction or conversations I may or may not‚Ä¶‚Äù This is where Warner tries to deploy a typical low-life politician tactic by cutting Admiral Rogers off mid-sentence, speaking over him. ‚ÄoeCan you, can you,‚Äù Warner tried to say as Rogers corrected him like an unruly high school kid, shooting back, ‚ÄoeIf I could finish please!‚Äù as he even held up a hand to stop Warner in his tracks. ‚ÄoeYes sir,‚Äù is all Warner could get out before Rogers continued, picking up right where he left off, ‚Äoe‚Ä¶ That I may or may not have had with the President of the United States, but I will make the following comment.‚Äù Ouch! Liberals hate referring to Donald Trump as the President of the United States. Rogers knows exactly what he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s doing by driving that point home. However, it gets way better as Rogers goes on. ‚ÄoeIn the three-plus years that I have been the director of the National Security Agency, to the best of my recollection, I have never been directed to do anything illegal, immoral, unethical, or inappropriate. And to the best of my recollection, during that same period of service, I do not recall ever feeling pressured to do so,‚Äù Rogers said, according to Daily Caller. The icy stare Admiral Rogers is giving Warner at this point gives everyone else in the room the impression that they just witnessed a greasy politician get a much needed verbal ass kicking from a much better man. Roger‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s definitive tone and demeanor completely dominate the dialogue in which Warner is clearly disadvantaged. Warner goes on to try bringing up ‚Äoepress reports‚Äù from the liberal mainstream media as evidence against President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s character. Leave it the lefties to use something as idiotic as circular reasoning in an official Senate Intel hearing. The fact that Warner tried to reference a load of bull from ‚Äoefake news‚Äù sources proves how outmatched he truly was during this hearing. ‚ÄoeMy accusations are true because someone else told me they were,‚Äù is never a good way to win an argument or solidify a congressional investigation. Someone should tell Warner this before he makes an ass of himself again in the future. I could not be more pleased with the NSA Director‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s testimony today. The ‚ÄoeRussian collusion‚Äù and obstruction accusations against Donald Trump are nothing but an attempt by the left to impregnate weak minded liberal Americans with the idea that President Trump should be impeached. Today, with Rogers‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> testimony, that goal just floated way out of reach for Democrats. Now, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time for them to quit wasting their overpaid salaries on sham investigations and do real work for the American people.
