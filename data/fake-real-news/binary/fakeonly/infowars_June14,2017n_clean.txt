UPDATE: CONFIRMED: GUNMAN WAS AN ANTI-TRUMP LEFTIST Congressman Steve Scalise was shot this morning in a politically motivated ‚Äoetargeted attack‚Äù by a leftist who deliberately sought out Republicans. The shooting took place during a practice for the GOP congressional baseball team in Alexandria, Virginia. The suspect was shot by Scalise‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s security detail and is now in custody. Other reports say he was killed. ‚ÄoeHe had a rifle that was clearly meant for the job of taking people out, multiple casualties, and he had several rounds and magazines that he kept unloading and reloading,‚Äù said Michigan Rep. Mike Bishop. ‚ÄoeScalise, a member of the House Republican leadership as the majority whip, appeared to have been shot in the hip and it appeared two Capitol Hill police agents were shot, according to Rep. Mo Brooks,‚Äù reports CNN. According to CNN analyst Rebecca Berg, the gunman had a conversation with Rep. Jeff Duncan before the shooting began in which he asked, ‚ÄoeAre those Republicans or Democrats out there practicing?‚Äù According to RSC Chair Rep. Mark Walker, who was at the scene, the gunman, ‚ÄoeWas there to kill as many Republican members as possible.‚Äù This strongly suggests that the shooting was a terrorist attack carried out by an anti-Trump leftist. ‚ÄoeI think we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re lucky that Scalise was there because this was his security detail, without them it would have been a massacre,‚Äù said Senator Rand Paul, who was at the scene when the shooting happened. We have been warning for months that the mainstream media‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hysterical anti-Trump narrative and the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s insistence that Trump is illegitimate will radicalize demented social justice warriors and prompt them to lash out with violence. It looks like that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly what happened today. The blood is on their hands. The media, the left and Hollywood must stop legitimizing violence and return to the realm of civil discussion and proper tone. ‚ÄoeWe are deeply saddened by this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected,‚Äù said President Donald Trump in a statement. CNN blamed the gun, not the actual gunman. Leftists responded by blaming guns, despite the only reason no one was killed being that the good guys had guns. Others celebrated the attack because they claimed Congressman Scalise was racist. These people are truly sick.
