Carr will serve as a close ally to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. He was a legal adviser to Pai on wireless, public safety, and international issues before working as the FCC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s general counsel. Confirming Carr as commissioner would fill out all the remaining positions at the five-member agency, assuming President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s other nominations get confirmed. The Senate will have to reconfirm Ajit Pai for another term; the president also nominated Jessica Rosenworcel to fill the remaining Democratic FCC commissioner position. FCC chair Ajit Pai released a statement, applauding Carr for his nomination. Pai said, ‚ÄoeI congratulate Brendan Carr on the President‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s announcement that he will be nominated to serve as an FCC Commissioner. Brendan has a distinguished record of public service, having worked at the agency for over five years, including most recently as the FCC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s General Counsel. In particular, Brendan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s expertise on wireless policy and public safety will be a tremendous asset to the Commission. I look forward to working with him in his new role and wish him all the best during the confirmation process.‚Äù
