No one can forget Ashley Judd‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sick ‚ÄoeNasty Woman‚Äù rant, and now, Elizabeth Warren is mimicking Judd‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disgusting performance as they both continue to rail against President Donald Trump. Warren is trying to kickstart a run for president as she threatens Trump with ‚Äoenastiness‚Äù as Judd is crying, saying she is getting cyber-bullied, and they both blame Trump. Now, the president is getting sweet revenge against the noted feminazis. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Elizabeth Warren was in rare form as she stood on an empty New York stage Friday night. Just across town, the horrendous rendition of ‚ÄoeJulius Caesar‚Äù was starting, which stars a Trump look-alike getting murdered night after night. Warren was reading from her latest book, This Fight is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Middle Class, which was written quickly by ghost writers to jump-start her presidential bid for 2020. Rattling on about the Boston‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Women‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s March, Warren read, ‚ÄoeOur very act of marching delivered the loudest possible proclamation of our deep down, unshakable belief that we can make democracy work again by insisting that this government serve the people.‚Äù She then started reading her favorite slogans from the Women‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s March, screeching, ‚ÄoeThis is a good sign: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Donald, you ain‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seen nasty yet.'‚Äù Townhall responded to Warren, reporting, ‚ÄoeElizabeth, sweetie, democracy DID work. And if we haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t already seen what ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>nasty‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> is, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll pass.‚Äù Trump got his own revenge without ever having to name Warren. Hours after she gave her talk on saving the middle class, Trump punched back, proving that is exactly what he is doing, with no help from the likes of Elizabeth Warren. The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt. Many new jobs, high business enthusiasm,.. ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 18, 2017 ‚Ä¶massive regulation cuts, 36 new legislative bills signed, great new S.C.Justice, and Infrastructure, Healthcare and Tax Cuts in works! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 18, 2017 Feminazis across the country took the ‚Äoenasty woman‚Äù remark and made it into one of their badges of honor. That spurred Ashley Judd to give her own ‚ÄoeNasty Woman‚Äù speech at the Women‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s March, something she has not been able to live down. After conservatives took her to task on social media, Judd claims she has been the target of cyber-bullying. She even gave a whining ‚ÄoeTED Talk‚Äù about all the hate coming her way, saying she employs someone to ‚Äoescrub her daily online reading so she doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t read anything that might upset her.‚Äù Judd found out what Trump supporters think about her ‚ÄoeNasty Woman‚Äù rants, especially after she doubled down, crying about the backlash she got. My on Online Gender Violence went live today. This is an epidemic that must stop. ‚Ä" ashley judd () January 18, 2017 you crushed me today. I thought you were Christian a lady of grace , you fell into #satansMarch you don't speak for REAL women! ‚Ä" SILENT MAJORITY () January 22, 2017 what you said today was disgusting! You do not represent me or millions of respectful women in this country. ‚Ä" Michele () January 22, 2017 Judd and Warren continue to play the ‚Äoewoman card,‚Äù trying to make Donald Trump out to be the big bad misogynist who is out to hurt women on a daily basis. Warren is pissed off that Trump called her out on her fake Indian ancestry bullcrap, and now, she thinks she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to be the Democratic nominee in 2020. We say, bring it on. If Pocahontas Warren is the best the Democrats can do, we can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait for the election. Pocahontas is at it again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren, one of the least productive U.S. Senators, has a nasty mouth. Hope she is V.P. choice. ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () June 10, 2016 What‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really irking Warren and Judd is their claim that Trump is fueling this so-called misogynist atmosphere in Washington, D.C. ‚ÄoeMainstream Media outlets turned Sen. Elizabeth Warren getting interrupted by Sen. Mitch McConnell in February into a bona fide meme. They even peddled T-shirts with ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>She Persisted‚Ä¶‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> emblazoned on them. Chelsea Clinton shrewdly pounced, too, scoring a book deal from the non-story,‚Äù reports Fox News Contributor Bernard Goldberg. He went on, ‚ÄoeWhy? To paint Sen. Warren as a victim, punish GOP politicians and prop up the Gender Card. And reporters did it again recently. Scribes whined when Sen. Kamala Harris got interrupted by male members of the Senate.‚Äù Indeed, Judd lashed out during her talk, saying, ‚Äoe[Trump] is causing women politicians to be cut off while speaking, he is responsible for so much hate.‚Äù But, she forgets one thing. Where were those headlines for Betsy DeVos? Washington Examiner reports, ‚ÄoeThe education secretary was interrupted repeatedly by men during her confirmation hearing, and on occasions since, but the Left has celebrated those interruptions, not denounced them.‚Äù So, idiot Elizabeth Warren and her feminazi sidekick Ashley Judd make zero points. In fact, they refuse to acknowledge women who view the world quite differently than they do. Oh, but they know best, they are progressives, just out to selflessly help women. Except, they have female blood on their hands. Half of the abortions they celebrate are little girls. They are nasty women, and those of us with values voted for Trump, we voted for truth. We who belive in God and country won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t let those lying nasty women stop us from making America great again.
