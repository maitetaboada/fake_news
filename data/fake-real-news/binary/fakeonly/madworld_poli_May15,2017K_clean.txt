President Donald Trump spent the day honoring our nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2016. While most Americans support the police and grieve when a cop is killed, a few celebrities and other liberal loons were very disrespectful about honoring the fallen officers. Rosie O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell and Cher couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care less about the fallen officers. Instead, they were busy freaking out about one thing, and it will piss you off. Every May, law enforcement families gather in Washington, D.C., for the weeklong activities honoring the nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fallen police officers. There is a national memorial wall and ceremonies all week, and the most solemn of the events is when the president addresses the nation. President Trump promised tougher laws on those who attack the cops, looking for ways to reduce violence against police. Tears streamed down the faces of family members when Trump said, ‚ÄoeEvery drop of blood spilled from our heroes in blue is a wound inflicted on the country.‚Äù Let's remember those who died in the line of duty and all Law Enforcement who are currently serving to protect us all#NationalPoliceWeek ‚Ä" Veterans For Trump () May 15, 2017 But, leave it to liberal loons to mouth off and politicize the event. Unfortunately, there are those haters in the country who have to make this event about them. While the ‚ÄoeVeterans for Trump‚Äù honored the officers with a respectful tweet, those who only hate made a mockery of the event. This entire speech is a dog whistle against the Black Lives Matter/police accountability/criminal justice reform movement. ‚Ä" jg () May 15, 2017 Such bullshit I want to throw up on Trump ‚Ä" Bernard Parness () May 15, 2017 Calling the honoring of fallen police officers ‚Äoebullsh*t‚Äù proves exactly how vulgar the left has become. They spit on everything sacred in this country and are now screaming about Trump lighting up the White House blue for National Police Week. Then, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Cher and Rosie. We all know those two are constantly on Twitter, posting their crazy leftist talking points and freaking out on anyone who differs in opinion. So, what are they all worked up about as Trump is honoring police heroes? They are unhinged about MSNBC firing Lawrence O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell. ‚ÄoeLawrence O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell, the host of MSNBC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>The Last Word,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> has just four weeks left in his contract, and the cable network does not appear to be interested in renewing his deal. Four well-placed sources tell HuffPost that MSNBC has not been in contact with O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s team of representatives to negotiate a new deal,‚Äù reports Huffington Post.

Instead, they think it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s armageddon because Lawrence O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donnell, who loses in ratings every week to Sean Hannity, is getting the ax. Lawrence O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Donell is a huge Trump-hater, and all patriots say ‚Äoegood riddance.‚Äù This shows just how out of touch the left is with what is going on in America. Trump ran on a pro-police platform and promised to change the atmosphere of the lawless, cop-hating Obama administration. Americans responded by electing him as our president. ‚ÄoeTo every child in America who has lost a mom or a dad in the line of duty, I want you to know your parents are American heroes ‚Ä" American heroes. They died keeping us safe. They are the pride of our nation. And we will hold them in our hearts always and forever. Their sacrifice will never, ever be forgotten,‚Äù said President Trump. These words brought tears to many of law enforcement personnel in the audience. Trump is bringing back dignity to police officers across the country. No longer are cops demonized as they were for eight years under the Obama administration. No longer will they be blamed immediately after a shooting. So, let those liberal loons and celebrities freak out about a nobody at MSNBC; real patriotic Americans know what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s important and appreciate the fact that we have a president who is restoring law and order in America once again.
