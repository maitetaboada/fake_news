A con man and Black Lives Matter thug crashed the graduation ceremonies at Bethune-Cookman University, where Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was invited to give a commencement speech, inciting students into turning their backs and calling DeVos profane names. Now that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been identified on video, he is getting his just rewards as patriots give him the epic smackdown he deserves. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. According to sources, the protest inciting thug is Bobbie Luke, who is nothing but a con man trying to make a name for himself any way he can. He has a history of turning up at riots and identifies as a Black Lives Matter ‚Äoeactivist.‚Äù He has a bogus ‚ÄoeGoFundMe‚Äù account for his so-called ‚Äoeexpensive‚Äù education, even though he is getting Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s free tuition plan. This guy is a real piece of work. Luke was captured on video running up and down the aisles right after Betsy DeVos took to the podium to start speaking at Bethune-Cookman University. Police officers were seen grabbing him, but the damage had already been done. Luke had enough time to incite those useful idiots to act like fools, booing as they turned their backs on a true patriot, Betsy DeVos. In the video, you can hear him and see him on the aisle on the left. Notice students were seated until he started his shenanigans: Betsy DeVos gets booed by black students. Unbelievable idiocy. She's pushing for school CHOICE that will help BLACK students the most! ‚Ä" Tennessee () May 10, 2017 Daytona Beach police grabbed Luke, and he was escorted out of the auditorium. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s where fake news CNN contributor Nick Valencia caught up to him. When asked by Valencia why he was protesting, Luke squirms and can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t speak in complete sentences. The truth is, he can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t tell anyone why DeVos should be booed and called a Nazi; he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just regurgitating the liberal narrative he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been fed. ‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like what she said and nothing at the end of the day is going to change my opinion. Basically, if you not, if you not, basically if you let money devalue your morals, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not trying to hear. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all I got to say,‚Äù said Luke. Wow, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the brains behind the useful idiots at Bethune-Cookman University‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s big graduation protest of DeVos? It just goes to show, liberals will follow the commands of any idiot who screams loud enough. ‚ÄoeAs Bobbie Luke is walking away, he can be heard saying, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I like your suit.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Bobbie Luke essentially ends the interview by saying he likes the CNN reporter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nice [expensive?] suit that was purchased with money, that according to Luke, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>devalues morals,'‚Äù reported 100% Fed-Up. Watch the CNN video exposing Luke and his idiotic explanation: One demonstrator escorted out of speech. ‚Ä" Nick Valencia () May 10, 2017 Patriots across the country have had enough of Luke‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bullcrap. Sheriff David Clarke stood up and called out the ‚Äoepetulant students‚Äù as he led a smackdown on Twitter. Most Americans, regardless of ethnicity, understand that what Bobbie Luke helped incite degrades our Republic. Everyone is entitled to free speech, but when it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tainted with hate and racism, it erodes what the real heroes have done, using protests to change things for the better. Shameful, disrespectful. To be expected from petulant students who need safe spaces when someone looks at them wrong ‚Ä" David A. Clarke, Jr. () May 12, 2017 These graduates are lacking any critical thinking, and they are displaying group racism at it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s worst. Can you imagine if DeVos was black and the students were white? The mainstream media would have skewered Bethune-Cookman University. But, since it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just a white woman, they think it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s perfectly fine. Sheriff Clarke speaks ‚Äoetruth to power.‚Äù As an African-American patriot, he speaks out, especially on the Black Lives Matter issues, and he takes a lot of hits because of his skin color. He realizes, though, he can do it without the liberal rats screaming ‚Äoeracist,‚Äù right away. White Americans tend to shy away from calling out the Black Lives Matter thugs because we know we will be called ‚Äoeracist,‚Äù but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to judge people on their actions, not their skin color, even if we get called names. We will continue to expose the un-American leftists no matter what they look like. Bobbie Luke proves how incredibly stupid these graduates are. Like sheep who can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think for themselves, none of them have any idea why they acted like fools and protested a fine American woman. Exposing them for who they are, we win in the end.
