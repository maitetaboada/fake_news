A shocking video is being shared on social media after a man walked onto campus with a sign in support of President Donald Trump, and things soon took a turn when one woman proved that liberalism is truly a mental disorder with her ‚Äoepsychotic‚Äù meltdown. Unfortunately, the worst part came as she paraded the embarrassing results of her little stunt publicly, for the world to see. The incident took place in the state of Washington, where a man was merely expressing his First Amendment rights on the Western Washington University campus. Unfortunately, it seems that at least one bleeding heart liberal didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like what he had to say. Of course, as we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve seen all too often these days when it comes to liberals, rather than confront the man with facts and logic in a debate, she decided the best thing to do would be to silence him. All caught on a video shared by The Gateway Pundit, the leftist had what many are calling a ‚Äoepsychotic‚Äù meltdown and began viciously screaming for a full 2 minutes. According to a video of the incident obtained by Campus Reform, an unknown student reacted to a street preacher‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pro-Trump sign by spiraling into a two-minute fit, at some points even splattering paint on the ground in an apparent attempt at artistic protest. At certain points throughout the video, passers-by stop to ask the woman if she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s alright, to which she seems to indicate that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s screaming as a form of protest.

However, the reality that this woman represents goes a bit deeper than just an obnoxious temper tantrum. What we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re really seeing here is the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s inability to acknowledge the rights of everyone. The second you tell someone else that they can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t say something is the second you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re in the wrong. In fact, that practice is a slippery slope and will eventually erode the rights that Americans enjoy on a daily basis and could eventually come back to bite the current wannabe oppressors in the butt one day. This behavior is beyond bizarre ‚Ä" it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s downright ridiculous. When it comes down to it, all this woman really did is show the mental state of the left and how liberalism truly is a mental disorder. After all, what else do you call an adult with a child mentality? The left can lie and cause chaos whenever they would like, but this kind of crap isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t doing them any favors. In fact, childish temper tantrums are only hurting their case and credibility. We all know how people act when the intellect runs out as we usually experience some kind of name calling or personal attack. However, this display is so much worse. Are we really at the point where we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to scream like children because we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like what someone else has to say? The left has some growing up to do, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be wise to do it sooner rather than later because it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only a matter of time before these actions leave them even more irrelevant than they already are.
