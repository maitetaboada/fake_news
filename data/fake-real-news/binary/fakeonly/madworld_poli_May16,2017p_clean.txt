In one of the most idiotic arguments ever, a former member of the Obama administration told the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that the travel ban is perfectly legal for any other president, but not for President Donald Trump. What‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s even crazier is what this attorney wants Trump to do in favor of Islamic terrorists in order to make the travel ban legal. Patriots across the country are pissed, and you will be too at this complete mockery of justice. Neal Katyal, the former Acting Solicitor General for President Barack Obama and the attorney representing Hawaii, the state that is suing President Trump to stop his travel ban from Muslim majority countries known to be hotbeds of terror, just admitted in court that the travel ban is constitutional. But, not for Trump since Katyal said we have to focus on President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s anti-Islam statements to derive the intent of this executive order, rather than the text itself. Laws and executive orders are not legal based on mind-reading. See, this attorney, a loyal Obamaite who also worked for the Clintons, is saying that, for Trump, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s illegal only because he alleges that the president hates Muslims, claiming he knows this because of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s words from campaign events. The truth is, Trump hates Islamic terrorists, but to these idiots, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all the same. Unfortunately, it gets worse. Katyal makes a second argument that is so ridiculous, patriots across the country are livid. ‚ÄoeThe lawyer representing the State of Hawaii in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit today has stated the collection of data with regards honor killings should be removed from President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Executive Order in order to ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>pass constitutional muster,'‚Äù reports Breitbart. Katyal added ‚Äoethat the collection of such data as outlined by the Executive Order 13780 [the travel ban] contravenes the Establishment Clause, in the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion‚Ä¶‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>‚Äù So, what Katyal is saying is that honor killing is Islamic and that makes it a religious practice, which means it must be taken out of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wording in his travel ban. Are these liberal loons completely out of their minds? Yes, they are. They are saying that mentioning honor killings in an executive order to implement a travel ban is against the First Amendment religious liberty clause. As Breitbart points out, ‚ÄoeIn doing so, Katyal appears to be making the case that honor killings ‚Ä" murder committed in the name of restoring a family‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dignity following discouraged behavior within fundamentalist homes ‚Ä" is in itself Islamic.‚Äù Of course, the far leftist judges on the Ninth Circuit are eating this up. They actually allowed Kaytal to present these preposterous arguments as they sat with a straight face, listening intently. Telling the court what Trump could do to smooth it over with the Islamic terrorists, Katyal said, ‚Äoe[Trump could say] the face of terror is not the true faith of Islam, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not what Islam is about. Islam is peace. Instead, [Trump says], ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Islam hates us. I think Islam hates us.'‚Äù Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s travel ban is to safeguard the nation from Islamic terrorists and those from the countries he listed who would do us harm. Why must he make a statement on Islam? This is pissing off Americans across the country who are sick and tired of this political game playing. One commenter, identifying as ‚ÄoeWCAGA‚Äù writes, ‚ÄoeIT‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>S OFFICIAL: We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve entered an alternate reality! This is probably the MOST BIZARRE ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>argument‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> to the President‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s LEGAL AUTHORITY that has ever been attempted. This lawyer should be disbarred IMMEDIATELY!‚Äù It was for 90 days to improve vetting process. This whole thing is ridiculous and just political obstruction. ‚Ä" Road SWVA () May 15, 2017 This is an example of just how screwed up the liberals in America are, and only those who can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think for themselves would applaud the display by Attorney Katyal, twisting his argument to the point that he admits honor killings are Islamic rituals protected by the First Amendment and that we, therefore, can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t discriminate against those who are committing honor killings. It seems the left will admit anything in an attempt to beat Trump. If this is the best they got to get a victory against Trump, then bring it on. The whole Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has turned into a circus, where all common sense must be left at the door. Americans with half a brain are laughing at how pathetic they all are; they just exposed their utter desperation at facing President Trump.
