PITTSBURGH ‚Ä" In the early morning hours after winning his third Stanley Cup while suffering from what is at least his fifth concussion, Penguins captain Sidney Crosby was seen getting a reminder of his accomplishment tattooed on his body. ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s an honour winning the Cup. But as with everything else in my life I know I will soon forget it,‚Äù said Crosby while the tattoo was added next to notes about who he can and cannot trust. ‚ÄoeAlso I need to find out who killed my wife.‚Äù Crosby, whose short term memory lasts for only ten minutes at a time ever since getting hit at the Winter Classic in 2011 also has a tattoo saying ‚Äoeremember Kris Letang‚Äù on his wrist. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m so proud to have won my first Stanley Cup‚Äù said Sidney as he intentionally burned a photo of him winning in 2009 and 2016 so his quest could continue. At press time Crosby, was demanding to know who everyone in the room was. Tags: concussions, Memento, NHL, Sidney Crosby, Stanley Cup
