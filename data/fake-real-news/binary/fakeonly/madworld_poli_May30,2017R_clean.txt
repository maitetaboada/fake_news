Sheer chaos erupted after a Democratic lawmaker threatened the life of a Republican. What could have possibly led an elected official to threaten such violence against a colleague? For starters, the Republican was doing his job, something that is known to infuriate the left immensely. Texas Republican Rep. Matt Rinaldi called ICE on a slew of protesters who had stupidly identified themselves as illegal immigrants, prompting more than one Democrat to come completely unglued. The protesters were holding signs which read, ‚ÄoeI am an illegal and here to stay,‚Äù and, ‚ÄoeNo SB4 No Hate.‚Äù When Rinaldi called ICE to have them deported, Democratic Rep. Poncho Nevarez threatened his life at that point. A shoving match and war of words nearly turned into a fistfight on the Texas House floor Monday, the final day of a bitterly contentious 140-day legislative session. ‚ÄoeThis session has been very, very difficult,‚Äù said Rep. Celia Israel, D-Austin. ‚ÄoeThere are enough of us here who remember a time in Texas when respect and decorum ruled the day.‚Äù [Source: Dallas News] Protesters with a "Here to Stay" sign #SB4 #txlege ‚Ä" James Barrag√°n () May 29, 2017 Protesters in Capitol rotunda right now #sb4 #txlege ‚Ä" James Barrag√°n () May 29, 2017 ‚ÄoeToday, Representative Poncho Nevarez threatened my life on the House floor after I called ICE on several illegal immigrants who held signs in the gallery which said ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I am illegal and here to stay.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Several Democrats encouraged the protestors to disobey law enforcement,‚Äù Rinaldi wrote on Facebook, according to Daily Caller. A statement regarding today. ‚Ä" Matt Rinaldi () May 29, 2017 Nevarez admitted in a Tuesday interview, ‚ÄoeI did shove him around a little bit, I pushed him because he needed to get out of there.‚Äù Apparently, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re only welcome amongst Democrats if you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re willing to break the law. ‚ÄoeI got in his face and I put my hands on the guy,‚Äù continued Nevarez. ‚ÄoeIn another exchange, I said, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>We need to take this outside because it shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get resolved here in front of all these people.'‚Äù The Democratic lawmaker added, ‚ÄoeHe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a racist. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a bad person. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not going to allow people like that to get away with saying comments like that because they think nothing‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s gonna happen to ‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>em.‚Äù Once again, it appears that the Democrats cannot control themselves, like a bunch of toddlers fighting over who gets the biggest portion at snack time. With Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi setting the example, should we even be surprised by the lows to which Democrats are now willing to stoop? What an embarrassment! It is truly amazing that these imbeciles continue to get elected.
