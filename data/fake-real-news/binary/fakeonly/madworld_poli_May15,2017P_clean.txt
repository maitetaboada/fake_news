The left is desperate to brainwash people any way they can, and that was exactly the case during the recent Miss USA pageant. Organizers of the event thought it would be a good idea to give a contestant a loaded question in hopes that she would take a swipe at President Donald Trump in the process ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about the time the entire room erupted over her answer. Although Trump sold his rights to the Miss USA pageant in 2015, his presence very much loomed over the most recent event in Las Vegas, Nevada. Of course, those now in charge are using the same production he used to own against him, which was proven when contestants were asked a loaded anti-Trump question ‚Ä" but organizers weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expecting the result. Kara McCullough, Miss D.C., was a participant, and she actually has a brain. In fact, the woman who would go on to win the pageant and become Miss USA is actually a nuclear scientist that works for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Clearly directed toward Trump doing away with Obamacare, each of the women on stage were asked if they thought health care was a right or a privilege. Suffice it to say, they weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t clever enough for Ms. Cullough: ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m definitely going to say it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a privilege,‚Äù McCullough said when asked if healthcare was a right or a privilege. ‚ÄoeAs a government employee, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m granted health care and I see firsthand that for one to have health care, you need to have jobs.‚Äù [Source: BizPac Review] As one would imagine, the room just about erupted when she gave her answer ‚Ä" and not in the way that liberals were hoping. Clearly heard in the YouTube video, spectators cheered and applauded McCullough‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s response. However, she wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t done ticking off liberals there, as she upset the hosts later when they asked each contestant whether they were feminists. Her answer was surprising, to say the least. ‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to call myself a feminist,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄoeWomen, we are just as equal as men, especially in the workplace.‚Äù ‚ÄoeI believe we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve come a long way and there is more work to be done. I think domestically we are making progress and I do believe that we will become equal one day,‚Äù the South Carolina University graduate said. [Source: BizPac Review] Once again, she was met with more praise from the audience. However, things were a bit different on social media as backlash was fast and furious: Dang I wanted Miss D.C to win but I'm sorry affordable health care is not a privilege. Health care should be a human right! #MissUSA ‚Ä" Kandacy Adams () May 15, 2017 ‚Ä¶so DC has no idea what feminism means. #MissUSA ‚Ä" rap god baechu () May 15, 2017 But, not everyone felt that way: Black people hating on #MissUSA because of conservative positions need to stop acting like owned brainwashed slaves to the left. ‚Ä" Darnell Wesh () May 15, 2017 Everyone is freaking out because #MissUSA gave conservative answers to the onstage questions. What happened to respecting everyone's beliefs ‚Ä" Josie Terry () May 15, 2017 This is exactly why the left doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like people who can think for themselves. What they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re looking for in their so-called ‚Äoeresistance‚Äù are mindless drones that not only believe everything they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re told, no matter how ludicrous, but also those who will do whatever is asked, no matter how insane. Liberals don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like people who can think for themselves because they will see through the fictitious leftist narrative, and this especially is the case for those in the spotlight since others might actually hear what they have to say and release that the liberal agenda is detrimental to our country. Too bad for them, people are beginning to wake up to their tactics, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to be through the help of people like Ms. McCullough, who aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t afraid to speak the truth, no matter how ‚Äoeunpopular‚Äù or ‚Äoepolitically incorrect‚Äù it may be. True progress is gained through truth, a concept ‚Äoeprogressives‚Äù don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem to understand.
