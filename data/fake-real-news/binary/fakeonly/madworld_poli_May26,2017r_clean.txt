Greg Gianforte is the Montana GOP candidate who made headlines for allegedly body-slamming a whiny liberal reporter. The mainstream media has tried to vilify Gianforte and have gone so far as to say President Donald Trump is causing violence against the liberal press. Well, Trump and Gianforte refused to back down, and they just knocked out a whole slew of the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enemies in a big way. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. The anti-Trump forces that were dispatched to Montana did their best, but it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t good enough. Greg Gianforte just delivered a knockout punch to the losers in the Democratic Party by soundly defeating their weak candidate, Rob Quist. Gianforte was running in the special election to fill the vacant seat of Ryan Zinke, who President Trump had tapped to be Secretary of the Interior. However, this was no normal state race. The rats who have been trying to undermine President Trump descended on Montana in droves along with the attack media. Anti-Trump funders poured cash into Quist‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s coffers in hopes of getting a victory in red state Montana. Bernie Sanders was sent to stump for Quist, all done to defy Trump and show the country that the Democrats were back and ready to roll. #GregGianforte: "Montanans have spoken!! Bernie Sanders & Nancy Pelosi CAN'T call the Shots Here in Montana!! Drain the Swamp!!" #MTAL üá∫üá∏ ‚Ä" STOCK MONSTER () May 26, 2017 For a couple of months, Gianforte has been harassed by media hacks as they worked, hand in hand, with the Quist campaign, like they did with the Clinton campaign against Trump. Just as the media colluded with Clinton, Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs has been a cheerleader for Quist. Every Jacobs report from Montana was an anti-Trump, pro-Democrat hit piece aimed at Gianforte. So, Gianforte finally lost it, and who could blame him? Think about it, why is a UK political reporter who works for the big UK Guardian covering a small time state campaign? Do the British have a lot of interest in Montana politics? It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s laughable, and Ben Jacobs learned the hard way about justice out in the wild West. Breitbart reported how the body-slamming incident went down, according to an audio recording captured at the time. As Jacobs confronted Gianforte at his campaign headquarters, the reporter is cut off by Gianforte, who tells him, ‚ÄoeWe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll talk to you about that later.‚Äù Jacobs responds by saying there may not be time later, to which Gianforte tells him to ‚Äoetalk to Shane,‚Äù apparently referring to his campaign spokesman Shane Scanlon. Undeterred, Jacobs attempts to ask another question, but then there is a loud crashing sound on the recording, followed by Gianforte yelling, ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sick and tired of you guys. The last guy who came in here, you did the same thing!‚Äù Jacobs is heard screaming, ‚ÄoeYou just broke my glasses. You just body slammed me and broke my glasses,‚Äù as Gianforte repeatedly says, ‚ÄoeGet the hell out of here!‚Äù The best part of this whole debacle is that the mainstream media is now pointing to President Donald Trump as the mastermind who they say is known for body-slamming his adversaries. They claim Trump is violent, and he wants his political allies, like Gianforte, to use violence. The liberal rag Salon touted the left wing talking point that ‚ÄoeTrump is the reason for Gianforte‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s violence against the media,‚Äù when they reported, ‚ÄoePresident Donald Trump has openly talked about making it easier to sue his media critics. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s incited violence against protesters at his rallies and allegedly wondered to former FBI Director James Comey if reporters who published leaked information should be imprisoned.‚Äù Trump supporters are getting a kick out of the leftist loons in the press who are pointing to this video below as evidence Trump is violent and likes body-slamming his enemies. Video Leak: Guardian Reporter Ben Jacobs Getting Body Slammed By Gianforte, Leading In the Polls By 15 Points, Sorry Libs, EZ WIN #Montana ‚Ä" Immigrants 4 Trump () May 25, 2017 President Donald Trump and Congressman-elect Greg Gianforte are getting the last laugh on their enemies. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s still in Italy, but his utter happiness couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be contained when he spontaneously mocked the press, saying, ‚ÄoeGreat win in Montana.‚Äù Great win, indeed. President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Midas touch on state elections continues even though his enemies tell you the exact opposite. Patriots are sick and tired of the attack media who care nothing about making America great again. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re sticking with Donald Trump, who we know isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t playing games with our future.
