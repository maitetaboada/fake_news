President Donald Trump was in rare form as Air Force One landed in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Trump addressed the press pool and his staffers on the plane, making it clear what he excepted from every one of them. Remembering the horrible optics of the ‚ÄoeBarack Obama bow,‚Äù Trump threatened in harsh terms that any American caught bowing would get a nasty surprise that shocked them all. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to love this. President Trump was just landing in Saudi Arabia when he shocked the mainstream media and staffers on board. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s trip to Saudi Arabia is risky. Trump knows that America is seen as weak and feckless after eight years of the Obama administration. Former President Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lovefest with Iran further destabilized the Middle East, and Trump knows, for this trip to be successful, he must show zero weakness. With so much on the line, Trump wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t going to leave anything to chance. Fox News reporter Steve Cortes was on board Air Force One, sitting with the press pool as Trump addressed everyone on the plane. The president made it very clear what he expects from the press and his staffers, and the Americans deplaning from Air Force One got a huge wake-up call. Last words from before deplaning Air Force One: "I catch one American bowing here and you're on the next Saudia flight home"‚Ä¶ ‚Ä" Steve Cortes () May 20, 2017 Americans across the country reacted to Cortes‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> tweet. Finally, we have a president that understands Americans don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bow to anyone. But, of course, this caused many of the liberal press on board to freak out, knowing Trump wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fooling around, if he learned that any of them bowed to a Saudi, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be packing their bags and sent back immediately. I love our ! He's our hero ! Americans first ! #MAGA #Trumpoursuperman ‚Ä" Nina () May 20, 2017 Yes!!!! That's the POTUS I voted for!! ‚Ä" BamaNicki () May 20, 2017 I believe Lincoln said a man should only kneel before God. Very sound directive from our üá∫üá∏ ‚Ä" Deplorable Abe () May 20, 2017 As President Trump deplaned with First Lady Melania, the press pool looked on, shocked by the red carpet treatment and fanfare that Trump received, something that Obama never got, even though he constantly gushed about his love of Islam. Liberals were badly mistaken to think Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tough stance on Islamic terrorism would cause the Muslim world to treat him with no respect. In fact, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s proving just the opposite. Trump showed his strength, and when you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re dealing with those Muslim countries, they only respond to strength. The Saudi king, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, greeted the presidential plane in the 101-degree heat as a brass band played, cannons boomed and seven Saudi jets flew overhead trailing red, white and blue smoke. It was a notable contrast from President Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s last visit to the kingdom, when King Salman delegated the task of greeting the president to a distant nephew, a provincial governor, amid tensions between the two countries over the Iran nuclear deal. [Source: USA Today] We have to warn you that liberal loons are saying that Trump bowed or curtsied, and this is just a straight up lie. ‚ÄoeTrump was also presented with the Collar of Abdulaziz Al Saud, the Saudi nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s highest honor,‚Äù reported ABC News. Trump, at 6‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>4‚Ä≥, towered over King Salman, so he crouched down so the King could place the medal around his neck. Liberal liars in the press immediately took this out of context and made it seem like Trump had bowed. Yet Trump bowed to the King‚Ä¶even China is sharing the video. ‚Ä" Penny Van Kampen () May 20, 2017 Fox News‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Senior White House Correspondent was one of the reporters on hand for the ceremony, and he set the record straight. A little accuracy is needed. did not "bow" to King Salman. He bent over so Salman could present the Collar of Abdulaziz ‚Ä" John Roberts () May 20, 2017 Trump learns from Obama's mistakes and shakes Saudi King's hand instead of bowing ‚Ä" Daily Mail US () May 21, 2017 Those snakes in the media can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help it. They can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stand that Trump has been able to pull off something Obama never could. Obama thought bowing down to Islam and apologizing to the Middle Eastern countries would create some great alliances with them. Instead, he sparked the Islamic State and emboldened Iran with his nuclear deal. He failed to understand that fawning over them only created a profound disrespect for America. Trump doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t apologize to them nor does he bow. He went to Saudi Arabia to reset the alliance with those in the Middle East who hate our common enemies, Iran and Islamic terrorists. Trump said in his speech, ‚Äoedrive them [Islamic terrorists] out of the mosques,‚Äù right to the faces of those Muslim leaders. We can stand tall today as Americans. Trump has gotten back our respect and made it clear that the United States of America is the world‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s superpower, and we are through apologizing to anyone for anything.
