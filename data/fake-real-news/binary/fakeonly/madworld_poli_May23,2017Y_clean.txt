On Monday, the U.K. was rocked by a devastating terrorist attack which claimed the lives of at least 22 people, including children, and injured 59 more. President Donald Trump, speaking from Israel early on Tuesday, described the radical jihadists responsible as ‚Äoeevil losers.‚Äù Then, he unleashed a brutal response the terrorists never saw coming. Just hours after a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device outside a concert by American singer Ariana Grande in Manchester, the U.S. military announced that it had killed seven al Qaeda militants in Yemen as part of an intelligence-gathering operation aimed at disrupting the Islamic terror network. ‚ÄoeDuring this operation, U.S. forces killed seven AQAP militants through a combination of small arms fire and precision airstrikes,‚Äù commented U.S. military officials. U.S. counter-terrorism forces, operating with the support of Yemen‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s government, raided a compound affiliated with al Qaeda‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Yemini branch, known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, which has been tied to the Boston Marathon bombings and Ford Hood terror attack. [Source: Washington Free Beacon] ‚ÄoeRaids such as this provide insight into AQAP‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disposition, capabilities and intentions, which will allow us to continue to pursue, disrupt, and degrade AQAP,‚Äù U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), which conducts U.S. military operations in the region, said in a statement. ‚ÄoeIn conjunction with our Arab allies, the U.S. will continue to support their efforts in bringing stability to the region by fighting known terrorist organizations like AQAP,‚Äù the statement continued. A U.S. Navy SEAL team, working with an Arab force, on Tuesday raided an Al Qaeda affiliate stronghold in Yemen, killing at least seven militants, American military officials said. The raid, about 30 miles north of the location of the SEAL‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s January raid, was launched from Navy ships, including the USS Bataan, off the Yemeni coast, CENTCOM said in a statement. [Source: Fox News] Although it was the Islamic State which claimed responsibility for Monday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bombing in Manchester, the killing of seven al Qaeda terrorists on Tuesday sends a strong message to the entire network of radical Islamic terrorists wreaking havoc the world over. Whether it be ISIS or al Qaeda, those who kill in the name of Allah all have the same goal. They are all enemies of peace-loving, God-fearing, law-abiding individuals, and they are all targets of the United States and her allies. Donald Trump has made it clear that no terrorist is safe while he is president, and he is not afraid of using the full force of the U.S. military to eradicate terror wherever it exists.
