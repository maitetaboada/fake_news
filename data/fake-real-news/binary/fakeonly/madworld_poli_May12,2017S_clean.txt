During the media-driven firestorm following the firing of now-former FBI Director James Comey, news hack Lester Holt was able to land a sit-down interview with President Donald Trump. The out-classed Holt interrupted Trump an absurd nine times in less than three minutes, but no one, especially Holt, owns a room like Trump. Breitbart reports that the interview was ‚Äoeinterrogation-like,‚Äù as Holt continually interrupted the president and even spoke over him. In one instance, Holt asked Trump about his May 9 letter ousting F.B.I Director James Comey in which Trump wrote, ‚ÄoeI greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.‚Äù Holt asked Trump, ‚ÄoeWhy did you put that in there?‚Äù Trump replied, ‚ÄoeBecause he told me that. I mean, he told me‚Ä¶‚Äù Before Trump could finish his sentence, Holt interrupted, asking, ‚ÄoeHe told you you weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t under investigation regarding the Russian investigation?‚Äù ‚ÄoeYeah, and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve heard that from others. I think‚Ä¶‚Äù Trump began to respond before Holt interrupted again. ‚ÄoeWas it in a phone call? Did you meet face-to-face?‚Äù Holt interjected, speaking over Trump. ‚ÄoeI had a dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on. We had a very nice dinner at the White House‚Ä¶‚Äù Holt spoke over Trump again, interrupting this time by asking, ‚ÄoeHe, he asked for the dinner?‚Äù ‚ÄoeA dinner was arranged. I think he asked for a dinner.‚Äù Holt interrupted Trump again when Trump was explaining he knew that he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t under investigation both from Comey three times and from a ‚Äoecommittee level.‚Äù ‚ÄoeSo that didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t come directly from him?‚Äù Holt cut in and asked before Trump could finish his explanation about the times he says he heard from Comey that he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t under investigation. Trump was unfazed by Holt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rude behavior and cut right to the chase regarding Comey, according to LA Times. ‚ÄoeHe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a showboat, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a grandstander, the FBI has been in turmoil,‚Äù Trump said of Comey. ‚ÄoeYou take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago. It hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t recovered from that,‚Äù he said. The two-minute, thirty-four-second clip can bee seen below. BREAKING: I was going to fire Comey anyway, Pres. Trump tells in exclusive interview at White House ‚Ä" NBC Nightly News () May 11, 2017 What we just witnessed in the clip above is a conversation between a man who is accustomed to leading organization and a wanna-be reporter. Trump has stared down countless challenges in his career and is not shaken by a few questions or by rude interrogations. Holt, on the other hand, was clearly working to maintain his tough-guy game face. These interviews always work in Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s favor, as he has authenticity on his side, while the media interrogator is trying to drum up a story with controversy. Of course, liberals hate to see Donald Trump handling the media in this manner, as they are accustomed to the love-fests that interviewers gave to former President Barack Obama over the last eight years and the softball questions they gave to candidates like Hillary Clinton. Hopefully, they will try to keep bullying Trump so that we can watch him continually own them.
