Barack and Michelle Obama are doubling down as the leaders of the George Soros-funded ‚Äoeresist‚Äù movement. They have been trying to keep this story under wraps as they go full steam ahead with only one thing on their minds, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s to take out President Donald Trump at any cost. Well, they just spent millions on one thing in an attempt to do just that, and Trump has to be laughing hard at just how desperate they have become. Remember when the Obamas left office in January and vowed they were just staying in Washington, D.C., until their youngest daughter, Sasha, graduated from high school? They rented a mansion, proving they would be returning to Chicago in 2018. Well, all of that has changed. ‚ÄoeLooks like former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama are putting down deeper roots in Washington: After renting a Kalorama home for their post-White House stint, the couple has purchased the eight-bedroom, nine-and-a-half-bath home for $8.1 million, according to property records,‚Äù reports The Washington Post. Yep, the Obamas have changed their minds, and there can be only one reason why. They are failing in their ‚Äoeget rid of Trump‚Äù campaign. The Obamas were recently shadowing the Trumps all over Europe, and they have taken every chance they get to vocalize their hatred for the current president and his policies. The Obamas are the leaders of the ‚Äoeresist‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> movement, and there is no doubt that big leftist funders have donated millions to keep the Obamas right next to the White House. ‚ÄoeThe $8.1 million purchase price makes the Obamas‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> new home the second-most expensive in the Kalorama neighborhood, behind the $23 million that Jeffrey P. Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, paid for the former Textile Museum,‚Äù reports The Washington Post. If you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re wondering how unusual it is for former presidents to stay in Washington, D.C., it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s extremely rare. You have to go back one hundred years to find the last president to stay in the District of Columbia after they left office. That was Woodrow Wilson who, like Obama, was a far leftist liberal. Ronald Reagan went to his ranch in Santa Barabara, and George Bush ‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>41 and Bush ‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>43 retired to their respective ranches in Texas. Even Bill and Hillary went to New York. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not only crude to stay around like a bad penny that keeps turning up, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s horrible for the country. After an election, the country is trying to move on, and the last thing we need is Barack and Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s big mugs everywhere Trump goes. Barack Obama and George Soros have been planning this ever since Trump won. Many may not know that Soros and Obama are behind a group of lawyers in Washington, D.C., and their full-time job is to find things wrong with everything Trump does. ‚ÄoeFurther evidence of Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s close association with efforts to oppose President Trump has emerged: a group of former top lawyers for the Obama administration has formed an organization aimed at utilizing legal advocacy methods to oppose Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s policies, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s heavily financed by billionaire George Soros,‚Äù reports Breitbart. Most Americans are tired of the ‚ÄoeBarack and Michelle‚Äù show. They had their time, they got two terms, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s way past time they go away. President Trump has to be laughing at these clowns who are pissed off losers, refusing to move on. Hillary Clinton had a war chest of over two billion dollars, and she lost. So, what part of crooked Hillary losing did they not get? They had eight years, and Americans are done with their transformation of our country. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re making America great again.
