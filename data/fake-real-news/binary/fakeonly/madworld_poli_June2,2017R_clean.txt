It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take a whole lot of effort for CNN to humiliate themselves on live television as they do it all the time. Unfortunately for them, they just did it again most recently during a segment where they all got together to bash President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoecovfefe‚Äù tweet ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about the time shocked viewers pointed out what was on display right in front of them. Mad World News previously reported on the nonsensical ‚Äoecovfefe‚Äù ordeal as it was revealed that Trump actually trolled the entire nation. Of course, when they learned that it means ‚ÄoeI will stand up,‚Äù well, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s easy to see why it was the perfect comment. However, it seems that the left has been so blinded by their hatred for the man that they were unwilling to see what was right in front of them. Even though the answer was already out there, the folks over at CNN decided to hold a segment in which they bashed the president for his deleted tweet. Unfortunately for them, they would eventually go on to make complete and utter fools of themselves in the process. As it turns out, Anderson Cooper decided to invite Gloria Borger on the show to poke fun of what they assumed was a typo ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s when things blew up in their face. Ironically, as the group was busy mocking Trump for his ‚Äoetypo,‚Äù they had a mistake of their own on the screen (at the 1:57 mark in the video above). During that segment, the description under network chief political analyst Gloria Borger‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face listed her as ‚ÄoeCNN cheif political analyst.‚Äù All it takes is one look at the screen grab from the show to see how CNN made complete and utter fools of themselves. However, it gets even better when you look at their bizarre speculative reasoning for the tweet: COOPER: Gloria, I mean a lot of people have been enjoying certainly all day on this year. You were reporting yesterday it was interesting though that Pres. Trump based on sources you talked to people who talked to the president say that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just kind of angry, not trusting people around him, not happy with much of anyone around him. Does this tweet figure into that the? GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it kind of does, Anderson. I mean imagine him home alone at the White House, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a midnight, and he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tweeting about his negative press coverage. And, clearly, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s something that he is obsessing about constantly, and even at midnight, and he is ‚Ä" and then, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know why he ended the tweet with covfefe, but he gave up essentially. But you can imagine him being alone and mad and feeling as nobody to talk to when he has to do his own press. And so he started but then he stopped in the middle of it. [Source: Breitbart] The left is truly pathetic and nothing seems to prove that more than the amount of time and effort spent on one simple word. Desperate to make Trump look bad at any turn, the only thing they managed to do was hurt themselves and their own credibility in the process. Word to the wise ‚Ä" make sure to take a peek in the mirror before correcting someone else. After all, you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to look like the moron you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re trying to make someone else out to be. That would just be ridiculous, right?
