Johnny Depp, the washed up drunk in public actor, just threatened President Donald Trump, and now, he is finding out that wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t too smart. Depp is in a long line of idiots in Hollywood who have threatened violence against the 45th president, and after the shooting of GOP Congressmen in Alexandria, Virginia, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d think this would stop. Well, Trump has just delivered a nasty surprise to the Pirates of the Caribbean star. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Johnny Depp has become so desperate to stay relevant that while he was introducing a screening of his 2004 film ‚ÄoeThe Libertine‚Äù to a bunch of liberal nutjobs in Scotland, he went way too far with remarks about President Trump. He was at the ‚ÄoeGlastonbury Festival‚Äù addressing about 1,000 festival goers, and he was clearly intoxicated, slurring his words. Depp said, ‚ÄoeCan we bring Trump here?‚Äù The crowd started booing, and Depp added, ‚ÄoeNo, you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand. I think he needs help and there are a lot of wonderful dark, dark places he could go,‚Äù which riled the crowd up into a frenzy of cheers. ‚ÄoeIt is just a question, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not insinuating anything. This is going to be in the press. It will be horrible. I like that everyone here is part of it,‚Äù he continued before he crossed the line and said, ‚ÄoeWhen was the last time an actor assassinated a president?‚Äù This type of political pornography has got to stop because that is what this is now. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s total exploitation by has-been celebrities who are looking to shock to get publicity, but since the shooting in Alexandria, this nonsense is now being taken seriously. If you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll notice, President Trump is now silent on these matters, and that is because the Secret Service is all over this, as Johnny Depp found out. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nasty surprise for Depp was an early morning wake-up call by the men in black. Although we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have the details, we can be certain it happened. The Secret Service confirmed that they are aware of Depp‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s comments. Threatening the president is a crime under U.S. law. ‚ÄoeFor security reasons, we cannot discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods of how we perform our protective responsibilities,‚Äù the Secret Service said in a statement. We know Depp reacted immediately to the Secret Service, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rumored the FBI was also on to Depp. The fifty-four-year-old actor had to issue a public apology, which he did through People Magazine. ‚ÄoeI apologize for the bad joke I attempted last night in poor taste about President Trump,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄoeIt did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone.‚Äù So USA hating muslim #JohnnyDepp wants to kill every American's President Trump? Let's finish murdering women beater Johnny Depp 's career! ‚Ä" ATX Trans-Fluid () June 23, 2017 It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rich coming from Depp, whose ex-wife Amber Heard accused him of abusing her physically and emotionally for years. Heard had photos of her face with a black eye and multiple bruises. Fox News reports, ‚ÄoeLegal docs published by Deadline Hollywood that went viral late Thursday claim Depp‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s team was aware he had ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>gotten physical‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> with ex-wife Amber Heard. Heard claimed Depp abused her during their relationship. The two settled their divorce in August 2016, with Heard reportedly receiving $7 million from the actor.‚Äù Depp, who is known for his violence and substance abuse, just screwed whatever small career he had left. These celebrities seem to forget that it is those in the heartland of America who patronizes their films and concerts, and those people are Trump supporters. I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think of a better way for the Hollywood elite to lose their stardom. Let their plight be an example to anyone else in Hollywood who thinks they are a bigger star than President Donald Trump.
