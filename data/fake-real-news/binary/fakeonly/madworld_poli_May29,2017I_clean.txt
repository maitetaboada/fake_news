It was nice when Hillary Clinton was being a sore loser and wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even leave her home. Unfortunately, it seems that day is over as she most recently made a public appearance on Memorial Day ‚Ä" but not everything went exactly according to plan as several onlookers saw what was on her face at the time. If ever there was an example of deceit and dishonesty, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dear old Hillary Clinton. In fact, she recently proved just that while appearing as a commencement speaker at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Although she once told us that her constant coughing fits were just the effects of ‚Äoepneumonia,‚Äù it seems that may not have been entirely true as she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s still hacking up a lung over 6 months later. However, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just the beginning of what is coming out about her as her most recent outing was turning a few heads as well ‚Ä" and not in a good way. Bill & Hillary Clinton & Gov Cuomo at Memorial Day parade ‚Ä" Michael Grabell () May 29, 2017 Taking part in the Chappaqua Memorial Day Parade in New York, onlookers were shocked to see what she had on her face. According to The Gateway Pundit, Hillary was seen ‚Äoewearing what appears to be the same model sunglasses worn when she fainted during the 9/11 memorial last year.‚Äù . wearing anti-seizure Zeiss Z1 sunglasses at Chappaqua Memorial Day parade. 0 ‚Ä" Josh Caplan () May 29, 2017 Now, for those who don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t remember, it was speculated that the glasses could actually serve a purpose outside of just blocking the sun. After all, when she was first seen wearing them, Hillary was one of the few people who saw fit to wear sunglasses on a cloudy day. Sick Hillary disguised her brain damage protection glasses as sunglasses. (Notice no one else has sunnies on.) ‚Ä" Mike Cernovich () September 11, 2016 In fact, several reports surfaced saying that those same glasses are worn by epilepsy sufferers in order to help the eye block out certain forms of light that may cause a seizure. Before long, quite a few people were saying that the theory was actually adding up. ‚ÄoeBlue lenses are frequently used to reduce the light intake of epileptics to prevent seizures,‚Äù Donny Gold at Liberty Writers News said. ‚ÄoeI myself used to use them frequently when I would go to concerts to stop strobe lights from triggering me.‚Äù Given her lack of fashion concerns ‚Ä" she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s regularly seen wearing pantsuits everywhere she goes ‚Ä" it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s unlikely her blue sunglasses were meant as a fashion statement. Epileptic patients often wear Zeiss Z1 blue lenses in particular because they are effective at treating photosensitive epilepsy. ‚ÄoeThe Z1 lens is highly effective in controlling photoparoxysmal response in a very large number of photosensitive epilepsy patients irrespective of their epilepsy or antiepileptic drug treatment,‚Äù according to a 2006 study published in Epilepsia. ‚ÄoeThe lens might become a valid resource in the daily activity of any clinician who cares for patients with epilepsy.‚Äù [Source: InfoWars] Once again, it was raining as can be seen in the pictures. Everyone around Hillary was holding up an umbrella, meaning that the sun was nowhere to be found. In the end, she was the only one wearing sunglasses, and it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t to shield her eyes from the sun. One can only imagine the ailments that Hillary is suffering. Of course, we can never take Hillary at her word as we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been shown by her constant lying about every little thing that comes her way. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s safe to say that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a good thing she wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t elected ‚Ä" for more than one reason.
