President Donald Trump is attempting to clean house of those insiders who are in cahoots to take him out. Now, it seems Trump went on the offensive and laid a trap, and one close Muslim adviser with secret ties to the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enemies has been caught red-handed. Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the shocking information of the political coup attempt that the liberals in the mainstream media don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want you to know about. The leaks coming out of the White House and finding their way into the mainstream media have reached epic proportions, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s affecting the national security of the United States. This is pure political game playing by the anti-Trump forces, and we have the behind the scenes account of just what is going on. If Trump is guilty of anything, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s that he has trusted those who brought neo-cons who do not support his ‚ÄoeAmerica First‚Äù policy into the White House. These ‚Äoedeep state‚Äù staffers think like John McCain and want America to interfere in every political hotspot around the world with invasion and troops, and to make that happen, Trump knew someone close to him was leaking negative stories to the press. So, Trump appeared to lay a trap to catch the traitors, and credible sources have identified the main leaker as Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Habib Powell. Remember, in the meeting held with the Russian ambassador, where the mainstream media falsely reported that Trump gave classified information to the Russians, there were only three people present who could have leaked to the press: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, and Deputy National Secretary Adviser Dina Powell. It seems that Trump laid his trap during that meeting, and Powell took the bait and leaked the bogus story to the press. Two sources from the National Security Council have come forward to say that Dina Powell has been leaking negative information about President Trump to anti-Trump media outlets, according to Got News. ‚ÄoeWe all know she slept her way to the top of NSC, working her way from the receptionist desk at Dick Armey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s office,‚Äù notes one NSC staffer. ‚ÄoeShe has zero qualifications and, given her ties to Huma Abedin, is a security risk.‚Äù Got News also reports, ‚ÄoeDina Powell is frequently referred to as ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>The Republican Huma Abedin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and is a member of Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Vital Voices.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Powell is a good friend of Huma Abedin, who worked with her husband ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>at the Clinton-linked consultancy Teneo.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Powell also has connections to Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s confidant Valerie Jarrett.‚Äù Powell, who is very close to Huma Abedin, shares the Muslim faith, and with Abedin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s known close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, sources wonder where her loyalty lies. In 2013, Powell dined with Abedin and the wife of wealthy Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. We must also note that other sources are speculating about H.R. McMaster, who Trump has already had several clashes with. Many hardcore Trump supporters see McMaster as a neo-con who also spoke against Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚ÄoeAmerica First‚Äù policy. Powell and McMaster are both in the same club with the Washington, D.C., elites. One staffer, who didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t come in under McMaster or Powell, said, ‚ÄoeI didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sign up for this sh*t and the American people didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t vote for it.‚Äù Rumors that heads are about to roll in the White House are true, according to Business Insider, which reports, ‚ÄoeTrump seems to be considering a sweeping shake-up of his West Wing staff amid the media firestorm that has followed his abrupt decision to fire Comey.‚Äù Dina Powell has got to go. President Trump has been very busy since his sting operation outed Powell, but we know he is quick to get rid of those he can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t trust. Americans don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t give a damn about these rats and their political game playing; we just want them gone. They can no longer fool us with their leaks and bogus stories. We want our country back and that means draining the swamp so nothing can stop Trump from keeping his promise to make America great again.
