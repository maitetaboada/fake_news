The Islamic State has released a sick video which shows jihadist completely ransacking and desecrating a Catholic church. Although we have seen many shocking videos from ISIS, this particular one is striking a chord with many Christians. It leaves most speechless, the absolute hatred and venom the jihadis are spewing as they destroy the holy site. Luckily, these barbarians got a nasty surprise, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not something they ever imagined could happen. This ISIS video will anger all Christians and people of goodwill. ISIS militants went on a sacrilegious rampage, smashing statues and setting fire to a church building in footage purportedly filmed in a besieged city in the southern Philippines. The jihadis gleefully topple crucifixes, stamp on posters of the Pope, and destroy statues of saints in the church, located in the city of Marawi. The video was first published by ISIS‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Amaq News Agency this week, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going viral. It all started on May 23, as ISIS jihadis rampaged across the city, burning some buildings and occupying others as they battled troops backed by airstrikes and artillery fire. They ended up at the Catholic church, and after desecrating the church, they set it on fire as you will see in the video. These ISIS thugs have made a huge mistake. They have taken hostages in that small city, including a priest. The Philippines is 86% Catholic, and they are extremely devout. In fact, when the last three popes visited there, they had between 5-8 million Filipinos who gathered to attend the outdoor Mass. Now, the Filipino president, Rodrigo Duterte, has sent in the military with a message to the jihadis, saying, ‚ÄoeHe will not negotiate with militants aligned with the Islamic State group, and that he has ordered troops to kill the gunmen even if they slaughter the hostages,‚Äù reports Daily Mail. Duterte knows ISIS are fanatics, and they can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ever be reasoned with. In the end, these jihadis will be slaughtered, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a comforting thought. They actually told Duterte that they wanted him to give them the land for their Caliphate, but Duterte laughed at that, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll see them in their graves. Daily Mail reports, ‚ÄoeIn a speech at an air base at Lapu-Lapu, Duterte said: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I was asked if I could negotiate. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m telling you now, you can kill all those you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re holding now, but I won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t talk to you. My order really is to shoot you and to shoot you dead.'‚Äù Filipinos are praying for the hostages, and so far, the military has been able to rescue most and take back all of the city except a small pocket that the jihadis are occupying. It will end soon, and they all will be dead; it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s almost too good for them. ISIS will never get a stronghold in the Philippines, but like Europe, they are ramping up their terrorist attacks. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time the liberal loons come to grips with what is really going on. They block President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s travel ban, and they think if we hold hands with the terrorists and sing Kumbuya it will all be okay. We should give them a choice; go live in the Middle East or get on board with President Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s plan to annihilate ISIS off the face of the earth. We don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t give a damn what they chose, but they need to choose one or the other. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s truth time in America, or we won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have an America in which to live.
