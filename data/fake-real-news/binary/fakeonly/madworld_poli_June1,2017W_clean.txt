In the wake of seemingly constant missile launches by an increasingly hostile North Korea, President Donald Trump has sent despot Kim Jong-un a ‚Äoespecial gift.‚Äù It has finally arrived in the rogue regime, and the totalitarian dictator is foaming at the mouth. The USS Carl Vinson and the USS Ronald Reagan have been spotted together in the Korean Peninsula for the first time since Trump announced in April that an armada was on its way to the region, a development which angered Pyongyang. The massive aircraft carriers have now joined Japan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s maritime defense force for drills in the Sea of Japan which are scheduled to last several days. The Carl Vinson has been on high alert since April and has already taken part in drills with South Korean navy ships. Meanwhile, the USS Ronald Reagan is back in operation following maintenance last month. ‚ÄoeThe Ronald Reagan and Carl Vinson Strike Groups were joined by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Forces (JMSDF) for routine training to improve interoperability and readiness in the Indo-Asia Pacific,‚Äù the US Seventh Fleet said on its Facebook page. The news comes just days after the US Pacific Command reiterated it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s commitment to protecting allies in South Korea and Japan following the launch of a short-range ballistic missile by North Korea. Indeed, President Trump has proven that he is a man of his word; he will not back down from a fight which threatens allies of the United States. Tensions are high in the Korean Peninsula, with the North this week accusing the US of conducting ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>a nuclear bomb dropping drill‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he intends to work with the US to deter North Korea. But China has urged restraint, calling on both sides not to engage in provocation. [Source: Daily Mail] The US military, in conjunction with the forces of our allies, stands poised to quash any threat presented by North Korea. Needless to say, Kim Jong-un does not have the vast maritime resources the US possesses, like the Vinson and the Reagan, two of the world‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s preeminent warships. To engage in a battle with our military would be suicide for the North Koreans.
