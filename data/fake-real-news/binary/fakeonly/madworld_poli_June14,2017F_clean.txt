Although facts pertaining to the tragedy in Alexandria, Virginia, are still coming out, the newest tidbit of information just made everything worse. As it turns out, it seems that the shooter wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t quite done ‚Ä" and officials just revealed what the man did right before the shooting. For those unaware, several Republican leaders were practicing for a charity baseball game when shots erupted. As it turns out, a gunman had asked if the people on the field were Republicans or Democrats before opening fire on several unsuspecting victims. In all, the wounded consisted of GOP House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, two Capitol Police officers, a lobbyist, and a congressional staffer. Mad World News previously identified the man that shot and injured 5 people as James T. Hodgkinson III. Fortunately, the man was shot by Capitol Police before he could do more damage, with President Donald Trump himself speaking out to say that Hodgkinson had died of his injuries. Unfortunately, as if the day‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s horrors weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bad enough, it seems that the deranged madman had even more sinister plans, which were cut short when he was he was taken out. It has since been exposed that Hodgkinson was a flaming liberal and Bernie Sanders supporter who even volunteered on the former presidential candidate‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign. However, as new information is continually coming out, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve most recently learned about what the man did that showed his true intentions. According to TMZ, Hodgkinson‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s social media was rife with anti-Trump hatred. ‚ÄoeTrump is Traitor,‚Äù one post read. ‚ÄoeTrump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Time to Destroy Trump & Co.‚Äù So, ultimately, it seems that the man would have been perfectly content to put a bullet in the president himself. In the end, though, most people know that such a feat would be extremely difficult, so Hodgkinson decided to do what was second best ‚Ä" kill those who support Trump. Considering the fact that he asked who was on the field at the time, you can bet your butt that this is exactly what he was thinking. For all we know, he could have been trying to spark a violent revolution, ending with what he expressed on Facebook ‚Ä" the death of President Donald Trump. Unfortunately for the crazed shooter but luckily for the rest of us, the only person who left in a body bag was him. The left can pretend as though President Trump and his supporters are violent, but the truth continues to come out. The majority of politically-related violence carried out in this country comes from the left, and now, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re escalating things to new levels. Furthermore, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re trying to use an incident that stemmed from their own ideology to enhance their political agenda and further strip Americans of their Second Amendment rights. However, when it comes down to it, this attempted killer was only stopped by a few good guys with guns, which effectively rips the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s narrative to shreds. Liberals in this country have some serious self-reflecting to do because this kind of behavior will not be tolerated. Unfortunately for them, they better get used to the feeling of losing because it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only going to keep happening.
