Rejected Headlines is a podcast that interviews writers for The Beaverton about the worst stories and jokes they have ever pitched to the writersâ€<sup>TM</sup> room. Ranging from the merely dumb to the morally detestable, the jokes on this podcast were never meant to see the light of day. But now, thanks to a strange breakdown in the editorial process, you get to listen to them! I hope we donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t regret recording theseâ€¦ In our first episode, actor, voice actor and writer Anthony Botelho burns the podcast to the ground by saying some very tasteless things about a Canadian treasure.
