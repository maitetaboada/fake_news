Every week Beaverton editor-in-chief Luke Gordon Field assembles some of the countryâ€<sup>TM</sup>s best comedians and writers to talk, mock and riff their way through the news of the week. Then he puts their knowledge to the test in a very important quiz where the winner gets absolutely nothing. Part panel show, part interview, the Beaverton Weekly Report is an hilarious look at whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s going on in the world around us. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll be just like watching CNN, only funnier and with fewer erectile dysfunction ads.
