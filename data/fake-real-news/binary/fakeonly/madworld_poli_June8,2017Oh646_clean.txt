Former President Barack Obama decided to grace the country with his unwanted presence in order to lecture everyone around the world. Unfortunately for him, things wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exactly go according to plan as he told business owners how much to pay their employees ‚Ä" and even liberals were left furious over what he did just before taking the stage. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no arguing that the Obama family is perhaps the biggest hypocrites in the nation. When they say Americans have to spend less, they go on multimillion dollar vacations paid for courtesy of taxpayers. When they say kids can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have filling lunches, they go out and stuff their faces until they can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t eat anymore ‚Ä" and the list goes on. Unfortunately, it seems that America and even the rest of the world aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t quite done being ordered around by the former First Family as Obama recently held a speech on income equality at the Chamber of Commerce in Montreal, Canada. In essence, he thought it was best to tell the businessmen of the country exactly how much they should be paying each and every employee they have. Obama said the world must do more to combat income inequality, noting that the concentration of wealth fans fears that governments exist solely to benefit the powerful, NBC reported. [Source: Breitbart] ‚ÄoeThat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a recipe for more cynicism and more polarization, less trust in our institutions and less trust in each other,‚Äù Obama said before issuing a thinly veiled jab at President Donald Trump. ‚ÄoeAnd it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s part of what leads people to turn to populist alternatives that may not actually deliver.‚Äù Unfortunately for him though, his sentiments were lost as members of the audience learned what he had done just before ‚Ä" and it was enough to leave several people downright furious. As it turns out, just before appearing on stage, he signed a contract for a whopping $400,000. For those keeping up, this means that for his 70-minute lecture, he was paid an astounding $7,700-a-minute. Star further reports that the venue looked as though it had been staged for a rock star with a red-carpet stroll for giddy VIPs and video screens for the peasants in the back to enjoy. The more reasonably priced $375 seats started at a distance where Obama was a tiny speck on a faraway stage. With that in mind, one can only imagine what it cost to be up close and personal, able to make eye contact with the man. As for the 6,000 in the back, who thought it was a good purchase, they would have to rely on the video screens to see him whatsoever. Of course, one can only imagine how those people felt after having paid nearly $400 to see a view of the man that they could have enjoyed from their couch. Even more frustrating, though, was the fact that he was lecturing employers on how much they have to play employees while raking in $400,000 ‚Ä" a number most people across the world won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make for several years. Like I said, the hypocrisy of the Obamas is really unfathomable, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s allowed to continue as blind leftists worship and follow their beloved leader like sheep to the slaughter. Obama spoke against American ideals ‚Ä" things like liberty, freedom, and capitalism ‚Ä" meaning that what he said was virtually worthless just like every other time he talks. In all, what he had to say wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worth the price of admission.
