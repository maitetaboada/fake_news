When Grant Berardo posed for his yearbook photo, he was proudly wearing a navy blue ‚ÄoeMake America Great Again‚Äù t-shirt to show his support for the President of the United States. However, when he received his yearbook at the end of the school year, he immediately noticed that something was very wrong. Berardo was following the Wall Township High School dress code when he donned his President Donald Trump shirt in the photograph, but apparently, someone changed the rules without telling him. When he received his yearbook at the end of the year, the ‚ÄoeMake America Great Again‚Äù logo had been blacked out on his shirt, despite Gerardo having received proofs earlier in the year with it intact. The last-minute decision by the school gave him no opportunity to dispute the issue. Berardo wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the only student censored. In fact, two others also had their political views conveniently edited out of the yearbook, as well. All three students had something very obvious in common, though; namely, their support for Donald Trump. The kid wearing the Led Zeppelin shirt wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t photoshopped. Nor was the kid wearing an Alice Cooper shirt, or the kid with the Super Mario Brothers shirt. Or any of the kids wearing college shirts, apparel logos, athletic company tees, and all the other stuff kids wear. Only ‚ÄoeTRUMP Make America Great Again.‚Äù [Source: NJ.com] ‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like the way we have to tip-toe around political correctness,‚Äù said Grant‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father, Joe Berardo. ‚ÄoeIt gets in the way of meaningful discourse. And, frankly, I hate being on the other side of it now.‚Äù ‚ÄoeBut this is egregious. This is a free speech issue. And if we come to find out they blacked-out Clinton or Sanders shirts, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just as egregious,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄoeWe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not zealots. We spoke about him wearing the shirt. He made a thoughtful decision to memorialize what was going on during the election. And at no point, did anyone tell him not to.‚Äù Berardo wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the only Trump supporter whose image got Photoshopped. The same thing happened to a fellow junior classmate. In addition, that classmate‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sister, the freshman class president, wanted to show her support in a different way ‚Ä" by including a Trump quote beneath her name in the yearbook. But someone nixed that also ‚Ä" again, without notice. [Source: BizPac Review] ‚ÄoeWe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re very angry,‚Äù said Janet Dobrovich-Fago, the mother of the two students who were censored like Berardo. ‚ÄoeWhen we saw that Montana‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s (her daughter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s) quote dropped out, we thought it was a mistake because all the other class presidents‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> quotes were still there. But when we saw that Wyatt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s (her son‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s) shirt was Photoshopped and we heard about Grant, I knew this was not a coincidence. This was purposeful and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wrong.‚Äù Never before have we seen such public disdain launched at those who support our president. Traditionally, support for whoever is the president, regardless of their political party, has been viewed as a good thing. By all accounts, the United States is in a better position economically and globally since the Trump administration took over from Barack Obama, but still, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re likely to be censored or worse if you express support for the Commander-in-Chief. Sadly, public schools are little more than indoctrination camps for the Democratic Party these days. I dare say had Grant Berardo chosen an ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m With Her‚Äù shirt for his photo, Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign logo would still be featured in the yearbook. The double-standard when it comes to politics is glaring, and the censorship of conservative viewpoints isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t doing anyone any good. Students ought to be able to express themselves, whatever their views are, and hold a meaningful discussion with whoever might disagree. Simply covering up what they think and who they support isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t teaching anyone anything. But, then, schools are not designed to ‚Äoeteach‚Äù anymore. Their purpose has become to turn out the next generation of loyal robots who will do their duty by voting for leftist politicians. Thinking for oneself is shunned in the public education system, where children are encouraged to tow the party line instead of making choices based on logic and reasoning. Truly, no one should be surprised that Grant Berardo‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s t-shirt was censored, sad as it may be, as this has been going on for years now. The left has created a well-oiled machine in the public education system, and its job is not to educate but to indoctrinate.
