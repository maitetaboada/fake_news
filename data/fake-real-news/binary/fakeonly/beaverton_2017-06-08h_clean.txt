By Darren Anderson As you may have heard, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been a lot of discussion this week about the acceptability of the ‚Äoen-word‚Äù after Bill Maher said it on air on Friday night. So I just want to clarify my position here: I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not racist, I just think I should be able to say the n-word and have been ceaselessly arguing that point with anyone who suggests otherwise nonstop since last Friday night. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all! Let me be clear, I think racial slurs are horrible. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not that I WANT to say the n-word, of course I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve simply spent the better part of a week online explaining to as many as 3 or 4 black people at a time that I should be allowed to in case I DO ever want to use it. Or NEED to use it, who knows?! I want to stress again that this really is not a race thing ‚Ä" because I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see things in those terms ‚Ä" but if black people can say the n-word to each other whenever they want and completely get a pass for it then I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see why I shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be able to say it (the full original n-word with a hard R) at least in certain situations. After all, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about context! What if I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m quoting somebody, like a rapper in a karaoke setting, or Quentin Tarantino? What if I hurt myself or get angry or miss a bus and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just the first thing out of my mouth? What if somebody calls me ‚Äoecracker‚Äù and I need a comeback (nobody has ever called me that but I assume it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only a matter of time, the word is apparently everywhere)? The point is, there are literally hundreds of contexts where I feel I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be justified in using that word in a sentence, and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been tweeting those ‚Äoeexample sentences‚Äù to black people ‚Ä" just as examples! ‚Ä" day and night with very few breaks for 6 days. Do you think I like it, that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s somehow fun or exciting for me? It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not, because I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not racist. What I am is strongly against the vague overall concept of deciding a word is bad, so much so that I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m willing to use racist language, constantly, on a trial and error basis for as long as it takes until we find an agreeable loophole. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a matter of principle. And THAT‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fun for me about it, I think. Tags: Bill Maher, free speech, n-word, Racism, white people
