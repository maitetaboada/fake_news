Every week Beaverton editor-in-chief Luke Gordon Field assembles some of the countryâ€<sup>TM</sup>s best comedians and writers to talk, mock and riff their way through the news of the week. Then he puts their knowledge to the test in a very important quiz where the winner gets absolutely nothing. Part panel show, part interview, the Beaverton Weekly Report is an hilarious look at whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s going on in the world around us. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll be just like watching CNN, only funnier and with fewer erectile dysfunction ads. This week Luke is joined by Beaverton anchor Miguel Rivas, writer Tristan Bradley and comedian/podcaster Cathryn Naiker to talk about the best and worst news of the week. They tackle Donald Trumpâ€<sup>TM</sup>s â€<sup>~</sup>an idiot abroadâ€<sup>TM</sup> tour (3:00), that fucking orb (7:30), Trumpâ€<sup>TM</sup>s latest Israel gaffe (13:00), the upcoming NATO Summit (15:30) and why old peopleâ€<sup>TM</sup>s inability to use photocopiers could swing the Conservative Party Leadership Race (22:00). Plus the Approximately Ten Minute Long Quiz deals with the depressing reality of life in Florida. Subscribe: iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, RSS Tags: Featured Post, Podcast, weekly report
