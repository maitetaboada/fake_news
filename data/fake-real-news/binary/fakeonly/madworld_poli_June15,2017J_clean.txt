On Wednesday morning, Rep. Steve Scalise and two Capitol Police were shot as members of Congress gathered to practice for a charity baseball game. The shooter was soon identified as James T. Hodgkinson, a Bernie Sanders supporter and outspoken critic of President Donald Trump. Then, moments later, a U.S. Senator revealed who was on the baseball field the entire time as shots rang out and chaos erupted. Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) was at practice on Wednesday morning when Scalise was seriously injured, and he had brought his 10-year-old son with him to help the team fetch balls. The young boy witnessed the horrifying ordeal unfold as his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s colleague was shot in the hip and subsequently tried to drag himself off the field to safety. Sen. Flake: "I wanted to get to Steve Scalise, laying out there in the field, but while there were bullets flying overhead, I couldn't." 20 ‚Ä" ABC News () June 14, 2017 It was Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) who very well might have saved the 10-year-old‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s life. According to The Gateway Pundit, Flake was not only a witness to the shooting on Wednesday morning but turned out to be a hero as well. He quickly grabbed Barton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s son and hid him under the dugout bench to protect him from gunfire. ‚ÄoeI poked my head up at one point and saw the shooter behind the backstop behind the fence‚Ä"he still had a line of shot, a line of fire into the dugout,‚Äù recounted Sen. Flake. ‚ÄoeHe was firing around but he still could have fired into the dugout. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why I kept everybody down.‚Äù The heroic Senator added, ‚ÄoeJoe Barton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s boy was here, a 10-year-old just shagging balls and we got him into the dugout and stuffed him under the bench.‚Äù ‚ÄoeLooks like only one shooter‚Ä¶whether he was targeting certain members, we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know,‚Äù Sen. Jeff Flake says, who witnessed shooting ‚Ä" CBS News () June 14, 2017 It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to be really difficult for the mainstream media to spin this one. The shooter was a Trump-hating leftist who broke existing gun laws in order to obtain an AR-15, and, without regard for the life of an innocent young boy, began firing at Republican lawmakers who had spent their morning preparing for a charity event. The press is definitely ringing their hands right about now over the fact that Hodgkinson wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a right-wing gun nut who they could use to paint Republicans as the party of hate and lobby for further gun control. I thought liberals were supposed to be all about ‚Äoeacceptance‚Äù and ‚Äoetolerance‚Äù? Well, Hodgkinson was apparently so tolerant of other viewpoints that he would kill politicians who don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t happen to agree with him, even risking the lives of their children without remorse. The only silver lining to this story is the fact that the shooter was taken out without fatally wounding any of the lawmakers he came to kill on Wednesday morning. Thank God that crazy liberal was such a shitty shot.
