On Wednesday morning, as members of Congress gathered to practice for a charity baseball game, gunman James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on the group, striking Rep. Steve Scalise in the hip. In the wake of the tragedy, liberals are now in a frenzy after discovering one detail about the shooter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s gun. As soon as a shooting unfolds, the left traditionally begins calling for further gun control, even though statistics prove that the best way combat gun violence is with less gun control. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe me? Just take a look at the city of Chicago, which has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, yet struggles with an astronomical murder rate. Unfortunately for the misguided liberals who would try to blame today‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shooting on the need to take firearms away from law-abiding citizens, there is one detail about the gun Hodgkinson used that will be very inconvenient for their narrative. As it turns out, the AR-15 used by the shooter was already illegal in his home state. This proves beyond a shadow of a doubt an argument which conservatives have used from the very beginning; namely, that criminals do not follow gun laws. In other words, if the only people you are actually taking guns away from are those who follow the law and use them responsibility, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re really not doing anyone any good. ‚ÄoeThe weapon is not legal in Illinois,‚Äù said Judge Andrew Napolitano, according to The Gateway Pundit. ‚ÄoeWe don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know where he got it or where he traveled from. It is legal at the time and place he used it, but it is not legal in his home state.‚Äù Individuals like James T. Hodgkinson who are intent on doing harm will find a way to do it whether or not their means break the law. Did Scalise‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shooter care about the gun laws in Illinois when he obtained an AR-15? Obviously not. He cared only about doing harm to as many innocent individuals as possible, which is already against the law, so what would stop him from breaking one more? That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s actually not a hypothetical question. It has an answer, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s simple. What would stop him is exactly what did stop him ‚Ä" a gun in the hands of a good guy. While Scalise was seriously injured in Wednesday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shooting, Hodgkinson was ultimately the only fatality, and for that, we can be grateful. At least his plan to kill only culminated in his own death and Rep. Scalise will live to continue his important work on Capitol Hill. Our thoughts and prayers are with him as he recovers from this senseless attack.
