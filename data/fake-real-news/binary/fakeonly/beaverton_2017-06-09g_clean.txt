Hot yoga is a great activity for your mind and body. Hereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s how to get the most out of it, despite the fact that the large heating panels suspended from the ceiling could come down and crush you at literally any moment. #metaslider_16616.flexslider .slides li {margin-right: 5px !important;} Take a deep breath: That panel is probably very securely affixed to the ceiling. Nothing to worry about. Exhale: But it is hanging from chains. Chains have broken in the past, right? How old is this building? How old are those chains? Lie flat on your back: Although this position will not protect your vulnerable face and organs from the sharp corners of that heating panel, it does allow you to keep an eye on it at all times. Close your eyes: But keep one open because if that thing comes down youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re going to have to make a forceful and decisive lateral roll. Envision: Your face disfigured by third degree burns. Stretch: Towards the person in front of you who seems blissfully unaware that if those chains break, theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re getting a face full of serious panel. Maybe you should get their attention? Give them some sort of warning signal? Open your mind: To the possibility of leaving the class. Yeah, you paid $20, but no one said anything about precariously-hung panels when you signed up. Come into a standing pose: And discreetly get the frig out of there. var metaslider_16616 = function($) { $('#metaslider_16616').addClass('flexslider'); // theme/plugin conflict avoidance $('#metaslider_16616').flexslider({ slideshowSpeed:5000, animation:'slide', controlNav:true, directionNav:true, pauseOnHover:true, direction:'horizontal', reverse:false, animationSpeed:600, prevText:"&lt;", nextText:"&gt;", easing:"linear", slideshow:true, itemWidth:700, minItems:1, itemMargin:5 }); }; var timer_metaslider_16616 = function() { var slider = !window.jQuery ? window.setTimeout(timer_metaslider_16616, 100) : !jQuery.isReady ? window.setTimeout(timer_metaslider_16616, 1) : metaslider_16616(window.jQuery); }; timer_metaslider_16616(); â€" 7.
