This is ‚Ä" this is not ‚Ä"this is not for Republicans to fix or Democrats to fix.‚Äù ‚ÄoeThis is for us as Americans to fix,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄoeSo when did we get to the point where we said no, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not going to talk to Democrats about a fix? We should be working with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. We should be working with our colleagues in the other chamber.‚Äù Follow Pam Key on Twitter
