Priceless footage of Maxine Waters (D-CA) is on its way to breaking the internet after she was recently confronted by a supporter of President Donald Trump at one of her speaking engagements. The pure idiocy of Waters‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> rhetoric is something most of us are accustomed to seeing, but wait until you hear the huge lie she screams at the conservative woman after hearing one simple trigger word. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. According to The Gateway Pundit, Waters was approached by a conservative woman claiming to be one of her constituents at a public appearance on Monday, May 29, 2017. As the woman confronts Waters and tells her that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been trying to contact her via phone calls and email with no response, Waters says she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been very busy and immediately starts the self-aggrandizement routine. But, her constituent isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t going to let her off the hook and continues to ask Waters questions about her views on President Donald Trump. Watch what happens in the video posted to Twitter by Josh Caplan. (WARNING: GRAPHIC LANGUAGE) NEW: Constituent confronts Maxine Waters: ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to work every day to make sure that [Trump] isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t impeached and that you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re impeached.‚Äù ‚Ä" Josh Caplan () May 30, 2017 The constituent said, ‚ÄoeWell I just want to talk about your representation in Washington and our President as well,‚Äù to which Waters replied angrily, ‚ÄoeI can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stand him! He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the most horrible man I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve ever seen in my life!‚Äù This is when the conservative constituent gets Waters going. ‚ÄoeI love my President,‚Äù said the woman to Waters. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m glad you do! Your President is a dishonorable, lying man. He mocked a journalist. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve never seen a grown man do that! He talked about grabbing women by the private parts. He lies every day. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in bed with Putin and the Russians about oil! And everybody around him are allies with the Kremlin and with the Oligarchs of Russia. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re gonna take us down!‚Äù yelled Waters. When the woman tried to bring up the subject of former President Bill Clinton and his corrupt behavior, Waters makes it clear she doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to talk about it and fires back, saying that she is going to work every day until Trump is impeached. The fed-up conservative constituent had enough and tells Waters that she will work every day until Waters is impeached, and there it was, Waters‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> trigger word. It turns out she doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like having the ‚ÄoeI‚Äù word used on her. She immediately goes ballistic on the woman and says, ‚ÄoeYou can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t impeach a member of Congress.‚Äù Waters pauses and restates, ‚ÄoeYou can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t impeach a woman of Congress.‚Äù Well, actually you can, but Waters is too stupid to know that. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives have the ability to impeach their own members with a two-thirds vote in favor of expulsion. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s truly epic to see Waters get confronted by her own constituents and to really witness how unglued she becomes when the tables are turned on her with the whole impeachment claim. Waters represents the worst of American politicians and should be impeached. Although the likelihood is slim, we can always hope. Waters should just do the world a favor and get out of American politics.
