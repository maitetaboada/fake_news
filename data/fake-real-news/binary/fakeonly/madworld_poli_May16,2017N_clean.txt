Newly-crowned Miss USA Kara McCullough earned the acclaim of conservatives and the ire of the left when she said that health care should be a ‚Äoeprivilege,‚Äù not a ‚Äoeright.‚Äù Now, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s got five words for whiny liberals who melted down over her answer. McCullough came under fire when she was asked during the Miss USA competition‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s interview portion if ‚Äoeaffordable health care for all U.S. citizens is a right or a privilege and why.‚Äù ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m definitely going to say it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a privilege,‚Äù McCullough, a scientist at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said at the pageant. ‚ÄoeAs a government employee, I am granted health care. And I see firsthand that for one to have health care, you need to have jobs,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄoeSo, therefore, we need to continue to cultivate this environment that we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re given the opportunities to have health care as well as jobs to all the American citizens worldwide,‚Äù she concluded, according to Washington Free Beacon. #MissUSA Miss DC just lost me with that answer‚Ä¶.Affordable healthcare is a privilege? Girl bye. 1 ‚Ä" Kat ü§-- () May 15, 2017 Miss DC was my fav but‚Ä¶ not after that answer. Everyone has a right to healthcare. #MissUSA ‚Ä" Charlsley () May 15, 2017 After receiving intense backlash for her right-leaning answer, McCullough decided to ‚Äoeclarify‚Äù her comments during an appearance on ABC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Good Morning America Tuesday, saying that ‚Äoeit should be a right.‚Äù Her answer quickly stoked controversy on Twitter, with some users saying they couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t support her due to her views. Asked during the interview Tuesday if she would change anything she had previously said, McCullough said she would want to clarify. [Source: The Hill] ‚ÄoeI would like to just take this moment to truly just clarify because I am a woman, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to own what I said. I am privileged to have health care,‚Äù said McCullough. ‚ÄoeAnd I do believe that it should be a right and I hope and pray moving forward that health care is a right for all worldwide,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄoeI am privileged to have healthcare,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄoeI just want people to see where I was coming from. Having a job, I have to look at health care like it is a privilege.‚Äù It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take a rocket scientist to see what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s happened here; Kara McCullough had the balls to tell the whole country how she truly feels regarding the health care debate, then the left came out in droves to bully her, and she subsequently changed her stance. As an African-American and a woman, you would think the left could get behind McCullough no matter her views on health care, but I guess those who shout the loudest about feminism and minorities don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t practice what they preach. Sadly, it looks like she doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have the backbone to stick to her guns despite their nasty attacks.
