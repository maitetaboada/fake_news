If you thought Michelle Obama was livid over her rejected school lunch program before, she will be downright furious now. President Donald Trump just crushed her healthy food legacy in an epic move to completely erase all traces of Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s horrible healthy foods program that had tentacles everywhere in American society. Trump made sure she got a nasty surprise that is pissing her off. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Poor Michelle Obama, her pet project, telling all Americans how to eat, is over. President Trump has ordered the Food and Drug Administration to hold off indefinitely on Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s changes to all labels on foods and on menus in restaurants. It was due to take effect in 2018, but now, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all been scrapped and thrown in the dustbin. ‚ÄoeIn 2016, the Obama Administration and Food and Drug Administration released a revamp of the standard nutrition label. The changes were designed to emphasize serving sizes, added sugars, and calories numbers, ideally to help Americans make smarter food choices. Former First Lady Michelle Obama had been pushing for them to be changed since 2014.‚Äù reports Business Insider, adding, ‚ÄoeThose changes were supposed to happen by July 26, 2018. But on Tuesday, the FDA said it would give companies more time to make the shift. The agency did not give a new deadline.‚Äù Nor will they ever get a new deadline as Trump squashed all programs on food after he learned of the debacle of the school lunch program. You may remember, it was just one month ago that Trump canned the school lunch program. Michelle lashed back at him, saying, ‚ÄoeI mean you have to stop and think, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Why don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you want our kids to have good food at school? Why would that be political? What is going on?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> You know, now that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s up to moms. Moms, think about this. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care what state you live in. Take me out of the equation, like me, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like me, but think about why someone is OK with your kids eatin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> crap.‚Äù Parents across the country were shocked and dismayed after seeing what her special, nutritional foods looked like. Kids were starving, and parents were chastised by liberal loon principals who backed Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s crazy plan. Even that idiot Chelsea Clinton went nuts after Trump stopped Michelle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s school program. Agreed. Sadly, many Republicans continue to argue against free school lunches & breakfasts & against nutritional support for families ‚Ä" Chelsea Clinton () June 8, 2017 That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right. According to the liberals, everyone that doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t agree with the Obamas wants kids to starve because that makes so much sense. Michelle Obama became unhinged in public and went on that tirade after Trump took out her lunch program, and she lied when she said, ‚Äoetake me out of the equation,‚Äù when she is taking it so personally that she can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even take herself out of it. Then, Michelle accused Trump and all Trump supporters of being bad parents. She said, ‚ÄoeCuz here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the secret: if somebody is doing that [canceling her crappy lunch program], they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care about your kid,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄoeAnd we need to demand everyone care deeply about our kids. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all we have.‚Äù Get ready for another meltdown by the liberal loons when they get wind of this latest event with her label program. She will get her digs in, the Obamas always do. When will they just shut the hell up and leave it alone? Trump won the election, their candidate lost. We didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want their over-reaching government in our personal business, we sure did not want their transformation of America, and we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want them managing our meals.
