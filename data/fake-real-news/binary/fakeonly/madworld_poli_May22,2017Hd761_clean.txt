Cameras were rolling as Air Force One arrived in Israel, capturing both President Donald Trump and his wife as they walked out onto the tarmac. However, viewers were later left shocked to hear the brazen admission the Israeli Prime Minister‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife, Sara Netanyahu, made to First Lady Melania Trump just moments after they landed ‚Ä" and a hot microphone caught the entire thing. As the Associated Press reports, the world was left baffled to learn that Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s trip to Israel was very well the first ever flight that originated from Saudi Arabia to land in the Jewish country. As it turns out, that was just the first of many surprises to come with the most prevalent being just moments after they disembarked from the plane. As seen in several videos captured of their arrival, both President Donald Trump and Melania could be seen smiling and laughing while being greeted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara. However, things would soon take a turn as a microphone managed to capture what the women briefly discussed ‚Ä" and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s already making waves. Sara Netanyahu to Melania Trump: The media hates us, the public loves us ‚Ä" Kevin W. () May 22, 2017 According to The Gateway Pundit, ‚ÄoeSara Netanyahu took Melania Trump aside and gave her a pep talk on the tarmac.‚Äù Even better yet, she went on to make a brazen admission that left viewers completely shocked. ‚ÄoeI talk every place about her, how great she is. And how great you are,‚Äù Sara Netanyahu began. ‚ÄoeBecause a majority of the people in Israel, unlike the media, they love us. So we tell them how you are great so they love you. We have very much in common. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll talk about it over dinner.‚Äù As we all know, the media is not a friend to Trump ‚Ä" but that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s apparently how the Israeli news treats the Netanyahus as well. The liberal media has evolved from a competent political opponent to nothing more than a bunch of sniveling brats with the mentality of children. As such, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re seeing extremely pathetic tactics up to and including the use of misinformation, deceit, and outright lies to hurt those with whom they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t agree. Of course, what they have never taken into consideration is the fact that people have the ability to observe and come to their own conclusions. At the end of the day, most people aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the mindless sheep that the mainstream media hopes that we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be. We don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t simply just believe the crap they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re putting out there, and they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re only hurting their credibility as more and more people wake up to what they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re doing. Sadly, that seems to be a worldwide practice, but if one thing is evident, We the People have made it perfectly clear where we stand on the matter. Time and time again, ordinary citizens fight against the efforts of the leftist media and expose them for the liars they are. Even better yet, we keep winning the game they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re trying to play by electing the politicians who they say don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stand a chance. The left can try to attack people and try to make them feel wrong for their political views, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not working. Of course, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not stopping them from whining, but they better buckle up because it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to be a long 4 (and hopefully 8) years. You know what they say, you can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fix stupid ‚Ä" but you can certainly expose it so no one else gets caught up in the embarrassing madness.
