The nation is still reeling after the attack on Republican Congressmen in Alexandria, Virginia. However, it seems that new details have emerged days later as police most recently revealed the one thing the crazed shooter had in his pocket while trying to kill innocent people ‚Ä" and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s downright horrifying. At this point, we know quite a bit about James Hodgkinson, the man responsible for Wednesday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s horrors. Not only was he a flaming liberal and Bernie Sanders supporter, he hated President Donald Trump. We also know he hated Republicans, and perhaps worst of all, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d made several threats in the past. Unfortunately, the deranged leftist followed through on what he had been claiming he was going to do for quite some time and tried to kill GOP members of Congress. Although he was the only one to leave in a body bag, Hodgkinson was able to shoot and injure 5 unsuspecting people, including the House Majority Whip, a staffer, a lobbyist, and two Capitol police officers. Sadly, it was later learned that the attempted killer was targeting Republican members of Congress, hoping to find them in a large grouping to open fire on. In fact, he asked one politician leaving the field whether Democrats or Republicans were on the field at the time. When he found out they were members of the GOP, he grabbed his gun and started firing. However, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not exactly the extent of this madman‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s motives as new information has most recently come to light. As it turns out, police have most recently released one horrifying thing Hodgkinson had in his pocket at the time of the attack. According to The Daily Caller, the shooter ‚Äoehad a list of Republican names in his pocket that was recovered by the FBI.‚Äù Hse GOP names on Hodgkinson list written in pen found in van: DesJarlais, Franks, DuncanSC, Jordan, BrooksAL, Griffith ‚Ä" Chad Pergram () June 16, 2017 The list was written out on notepad paper and found in the shooter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pocket, according to multiple sources with intimate knowledge of the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the investigation. The list of names included Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan and Arizona Rep. Trent Franks, TheDC has confirmed. Fox News reported after this story that Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, Tennessee Rep. Scott DesJarlais and Virginia Rep. Morgan Griffith are also on the list. All six congressmen are members of the House Freedom Caucus, which contains the lower chamber‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s most conservative members. [Source: The Daily Caller] Although liberal activists like Bill Maher seem shocked that this attack was carried out by someone on the left, it seems that the vast majority of violence these days comes from only one side of the aisle. While those of us on the right like our guns, we not only respect life but we also respect our guns, and we certainly aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t going senselessly take innocent lives or give Democrats a reason to take our guns away. The left, on the other hand, seems to have no problem with violence. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why Democrat run cities are the deadliest. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why most of the attacks happening at political rallies start at the hands of so-called ‚Äoeprogressives.‚Äù In fact, the last time our country had a civil war, it was instigated by Democrats as they fired the first shot. You can try to blame guns all you want, but people like Hodgkinson are proving that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the tool, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the person behind it ‚Ä" period.
