Sheriff David Clarke, the no-nonsense conservative lawman who currently is serving Milwaukee County, just made an announcement about his future that is rocking the political world. Clarke, 60, came out early on as one of President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s most verdant supporters, and now, he is moving on to a new assignment that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s causing the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enemies to freak out. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to love this. Sheriff David Clarke is leaving his post as Milwaukee County Sheriff and has accepted the job as an assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security. The conservative firebrand told WISN-AM in Milwaukee that he will work in the Office of Partnership and Engagement as a liaison to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. He said that he will start in June. This is causing the liberal loons in the Democratic Party and their partners in the mainstream media to have a complete meltdown. Immediately, as the news broke, Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enemies took to social media to start a campaign against Clarke. One of them is a Barack Obama holdover, Phillip McNamara, who is out of a job as Clarke takes over his position. McNamara is a whiner who is freaking out about Trump cleaning house. ‚ÄoeSo much for Sheriff Clarke‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ability to work with #Democratic governors and mayors, he is too polarizing and calls critics #snowflakes,‚Äù McNamara said. Wow, these Obamaites don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand that Americans voted to drain the swamp. I'm being replaced by #SheriffClarke. My job was to work with state and local officials. Clarke says he wants to strangle #Democrats ‚Ä" Phil McNamara () May 17, 2017 Patriots were celebrating Clarke‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s appointment as the liberal loons dug in, trying to tarnish his stellar reputation. They are focusing on a horrible incident that happened in a Milwaukee County jail, where a prisoner was found dead. Although Clarke oversees the jails as sheriff, he was not found culpable by prosecutors of any wrongdoing, but the facts aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stopping the Trump-haters from trying to pin it on Clarke. ‚ÄoeThe appointment comes just two weeks after an inquest into the dehydration death of an inmate at the Milwaukee County Jail recommended criminal charges against as many as seven staffers. Clarke wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t among them,‚Äù reports Fox News. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got, a tragedy that Clarke isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t responsible for, so Americans across the country weighed in by ignoring the mainstream media‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s take and rightfully congratulating Clarke on his new assignment. Sheriff David Clarke Accepts Position On Trump Administration As Assistant Secretary Of Homeland Security.#Trump üá∫üá∏#SheriffClarke ‚Ä" »º‚,,"…®…≤≈£‡πè…≤  ç…®»ºhƒ...‚,¨‚,," () May 17, 2017 Clarke‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father was a paratrooper, and he grew up in Milwaukee. He is a staunch pro-life advocate, calling Planned Parenthood ‚ÄoePlanned Genocide.‚Äù He has spoken extensively against the Black Lives Matter movement, referring to it as ‚ÄoeBlack Lies Matter‚Äù and describing the movement as a hate group. Clarke spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. In October 2016, Clarke tweeted, ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s incredible that our institutions of gov, WH, Congress, DOJ, and big media are corrupt & all we do is bitch. Pitchforks and torches time,‚Äù with an attached photo of an angry mob holding pitchforks and torches. Patriots cheered this tweet while the liberals used it to say Clarke was calling for violence. What a joke. With Sheriff Clarke at the Department of Homeland Security, we are hoping he will continue to clean house, ridding Washington of the Obama holdovers who have burrowed into positions. As many hide their politics and stay on, like McNamara who Clarke is finally replacing, they must be rooted out and fired. These are the leakers who are wrongly damaging President Donald Trump in what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s becoming an obvious coup attempt, so it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a no-brainer to hire a badass like Clarke to take over and go scorched earth on those rats who are working to undermine the agenda that Americans voted for. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be quaking in my boots if I was them; Sheriff Clarke is old school and doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mess around.
