A white Western woman made headlines after running away with her children in order to marry an ISIS fighter in the Middle East. Unfortunately for her, it seems that she may have gotten a bit more attention than she wanted as she most recently was raised to the top of the U.S. kill list ‚Ä" and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been seen with one chilling thing just feet away from her at all times ever since. Sally Jones, a former punk rocker turned traitor, may have been in for a bit more than she bargained after leaving Britain for Syria. Of course, we now know that she went there to marry an ISIS fighter and has been using her knowledge of the West to help recruit potential fighters, both in the Middle East and back home. However, being quite good at what she does backfired on her, resulting in officials, both in her home country and in the U.S., keeping a close eye on her. Even worse for her, the Pentagon recently deemed Sally a ‚Äoehigh priority‚Äù for assassination and raised her to the top of the ‚Äoekill list.‚Äù According to The Times, evidence was found proving that Sally and her late husband were the driving force behind at least a dozen ISIS terror plots. As a result, officials all across the globe want her dead, but that might not be an easy feat. Come to find out, Sally has heard about the bounty on her head and decided to make things as difficult as humanly possible for those trying to kill her. Since learning the news, the jihadi bride has been seen with one chilling thing just feet away from her at all times ‚Ä" and there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s actually a sick reason for it. The Sun reports that Sally is using her young, 11-year-old son, Jojo, as a human shield to protect her from US drone strikes. Of course, the plan works bifold and has so far been successful. First, the U.S. would face a backlash from all over the world and it would result in very bad public relations if the child were killed by our drone strike. Furthermore, if they were both wiped out, their deaths would serve as strong anti-American propaganda, resulting in more hate toward the U.S. and, most likely, a bump in ISIS recruitment. Effectively, Sally seemingly wins either way by using her son as a human shield. The horrifying stunt will either keep her alive or she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll get to be a martyr for Allah, thereby furthering her agenda after she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s gone. Either way, she gets what she wants. Unfortunately for her, it looks like she may soon be subject to the latter of those two options. As it turns out, her husband tried the same cowardly tactic and risked going into public with one of their children only for a bomb to be dropped on them. Now, the widow and mother of one deceased child wishes the same fate on her last remaining offspring. Islam is cowardly, to say the least, but if ever there was a clear-cut case of that, this is it. Mothers are supposed to protect their children no matter what ‚Ä" it should be instinct. However, when a cultish ideology infects one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mind, superseding that natural reaction, well, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no arguing that there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s something wrong with that picture. Sadly, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the case with Sally. Her child serves as nothing more than a prop ‚Ä" either to help keep her alive or serve a purpose after she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s gone. She could have avoided it all, but she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s willingly choosing to put her own son in harm‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s way, even risking the chance that it may get him killed. This woman is no mother. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a deluded shell of a human being, brainwashed and corrupted by an ideology that only teaches death ‚Ä" and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s proving just that by what she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s putting her child through right now.
