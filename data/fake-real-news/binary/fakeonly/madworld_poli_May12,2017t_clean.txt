It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no secret that proudly proclaiming your support for conservative values or Republican politicians can cost you your career in Hollywood. However, what ABC just did in the wake of actor Tim Allen‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s support for President Donald Trump going viral is quite shocking. Allen, who describes himself as a fiscal conservative, infamously spoke out against Hollywood liberals who are notorious for bullying Trump supporters. Unfortunately, he has not walked away unscathed after taking that stance. ABC confirmed on Wednesday that Last Man Standing, which stars Allen as the politically conservative and Christian character Mike Baxter, is being canceled despite showing strong ratings. Variety reports, ‚ÄoeLast Man Standing was ahead of the curve in the cultural sense as Allen played a conservative-minded patriarch who runs a sporting goods store and opines about the modern world, including political topics such as Obamacare and environmental policy.‚Äù It was considered the perfect sitcom for the Trump era, hitting ratings highs in its sixth season. But that didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t save Last Man Standing from a cancellation today. ABC has opted not to renew the longtime Friday 8 PM anchor for Season 7 despite the fact that the blue-collar sitcom was ABC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s second most watched comedy this season with 8.1 million viewers in Live +7, only behind flagship Modern Family (8.7 million). It was the third most watched ABC scripted series overall behind Grey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Anatomy and Modern Family. [Source: Deadline] Fans of Allen‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s show have already taken to social media to express their contempt over the cancellation of Last Man Standing. ABC cancelled Last Man Standing despite high ratings. PLEASE produce the show without ABC, Netflix original maybe?? ‚Ä" Joanna Rodriguez () May 11, 2017 Hey pleeeeease pickup #LastManStanding, it's such a great family show, I promise it'll be worth it. Poor poor choice . ‚Ä" Cara Whitley () May 11, 2017 Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live in March, Allen seemed to foreshadow his own demise, saying, ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not kidding. You gotta be real careful around here. You get beat up if you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe what everybody believes,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄoeThis is like ‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>30s Germany,‚Äù Allen added. ‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what happened. If you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not part of the group, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>You know what we believe is right,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> I go, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Well, I might have a problem with that.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m a comedian, I like going [off] on both sides.‚Äù Apparently, ABC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s liberal network execs are more committed to the progressive agenda than they are to their bottom line, which is no way to run a business. We have already seen what happens to companies which put partisan politics before the values of their customers. Take Target, for example, which saw it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s stock plummet after instituting a transgender restroom policy. You would think that these liberal entities would learn from the past, but then, the left has never been accused of being particularly intelligent.
