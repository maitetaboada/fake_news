Although the left thought that the death of DNC leaker Seth Rich was finally far from the public spotlight, they were sadly mistaken. In fact, things just got a whole lot worse for them as the deceased man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family detective most recently appeared on Sean Hannity‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s show ‚Ä" and he dropped a bombshell on live television that has liberals in a full-blown panic. Most of the world hoped that something would come from the suspicious death of a man thought to be responsible for exposing the truth behind the Democratic Party to WikiLeaks. For those unaware, Seth Rich was gunned down near his Washington, D.C., home in what officials have deemed a robbery gone wrong ‚Ä" but neither his wallet nor his watch was taken. Seeing how local police have just about let the case grow cold without exerting any serious effort into finding the person responsible, the man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s name went unheard for several months. However, that all took a turn recently after Seth‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family decided to hire a detective by the name of Rod Wheeler, who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s now coming forward with disturbing news. Wheeler was able to determine that Seth was, in fact, sending thousands of documents to people who everyone, even the detective, seems to believe were operatives working for WikiLeaks. As it turns out, that line was just the first of many drawn between the scattered and seemingly unconnected dots of this case. Wheeler was asked to appear for a brief interview on last night‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s episode of Hannity, where he would drop a bombshell so significant that it has liberals downright frantic. Although Wheeler knows of the emails Seth had sent just before his death, he actually hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seen the man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s computer and decided to call the police to see if he could have a look. As heard in Wheeler‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s account given to Sean Hannity, Seth‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family later got a call from a member of the DNC asking why the detective was ‚Äoesnooping around.‚Äù ‚ÄoeHere‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s one other thing that is going to be startling‚Ä¶I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days,‚Äù Wheeler first explained before dropping the massive truth bomb. ‚ÄoeGuess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high-ranking official at the DNC ‚Ä" check this out ‚Ä" a high-ranking official at the DNC ‚Ä" when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around,‚Äù Wheeler added, according to The Gateway Pundit. In short, it looks as though the police department and the DNC are working together in a relationship that, frankly, shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exist. Even worse yet, the DNC employee who called the family was actually the same man who Seth was having problems with just prior to his death. Of course, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no hardcore proof of a massive cover-up quite yet, but we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re starting to get a look at the bigger picture here ‚Ä" and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not pretty. Although it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just speculation at this point, you really have to wonder why the police would have called anyone in this regard if they were serious about finding out the truth. Justice is supposed to be blind, but that clearly isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the case here. For some reason, people are working together in ways that really don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make any sense. There is absolutely no reason for the DNC to be involved in something that they are possibly implicated in, so for the police to keep them up-to-date is beyond bizarre. I have a feeling that we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to find out a lot more in the coming days. Stay tuned, this could be about to get very interesting.
