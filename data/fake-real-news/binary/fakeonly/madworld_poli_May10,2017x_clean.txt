Kellyanne Conway made her return appearance on CNN soon after the firing of now-former FBI Director James Comey. Host Anderson Cooper fired off a number of tired liberal narratives about Russia and Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s emails, and he even threw in an eye roll, a move that he came to regret. Few people are better at handling the liberal media than Conway, who rose to prominence after her performance during the presidential election of 2016. Now that President Donald Trump has finally removed Comey from his position atop the FBI, liberals like Cooper are pouncing on the issue, hoping to somehow paint Trump as corrupt and tie him to Russia. The entire Russia narrative has been absurd from the beginning. During the campaign, Hillary Clinton was having trouble even filling small venues at her rallies, while Trump was filling entire arenas. At the time, Democrats started to get the sense that Trump had a chance, so they conceived silly stories like the Russia collusion one to discredit Trump. Hillary is gone now, and Trump is succeeding as president, so all that liberals know to do is to keep beating the same tired, old drum. As Mail Online reports, CNN‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Cooper continually pestered Conway regarding the timing of Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s firing, as the embattled FBI boss was said to be leading an investigation into Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s supposed relationship with Russia. ‚ÄoeThis has nothing to do with Russia,‚Äù Conway responded. Cooper became so disgusted to experience another on-air failure of the absurd Russian narrative that he fired off a childish eye roll as Conway spoke that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d quickly come to regret. Sites like Mashable noticed the expression and are now having a field day with the clip. Of course, Twitter has gone wild over the footage, as well. this anderson cooper eyeroll at kellyanne conway is‚Ä¶ choice DU ‚Ä" tc () May 10, 2017 The back and forth went on for some time, but anyone who watched it knew that Conway had gotten the best of the left-leaning Cooper, who did his best to press the false narrative. ‚ÄoeSomebody must be getting $50 every time (Russia) is said on TV‚Ä¶ (This) has everything to do with whether the current FBI director has the President‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s confidence and can faithfully execute his duties,‚Äù Conway said. Eventually, Conway grew tired of Cooper‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s antics, and she calmly corrected him. ‚ÄoeI think you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re looking at the wrong set of facts here. In other words, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going back to the campaign. This man is the President of the United States, he acted decisively today,‚Äù she said. Watch the entire interview for yourself, below: In truth, liberals like Cooper cannot fathom that their messiah, Hillary Clinton, got trounced by a non-politician like Donald J. Trump. Now, the more that President Trump succeeds, the more their state of disbelief grows. The Russia narrative is ridiculous, but it is not likely to go away for some time. Now, we are waiting to see what Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s soon-to-be acting FBI Director will do regarding the entire matter. It should also be noted that Democrats were once furious with James Comey, saying that he handed the election victory to Donald Trump by investigating Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s email problems in the first place. Liberals continue to lose to Trump and do not see the prospect of significant victory anytime soon. The more that they lose, the more that they squirm and present ludicrous arguments. America truly is becoming great again ‚Ä" despite the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s best efforts to hinder true progress.
