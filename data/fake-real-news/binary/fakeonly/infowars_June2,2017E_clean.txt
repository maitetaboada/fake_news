Another day, another excuse for why Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election. This time, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s blaming the American form of government, and in the process, belittling the success of every female world leader that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s come before her. During an appearance at the Book Expo to plug her yet-to-be-released book, Hillary said female leaders have fared better in parliamentary forms of government, and blamed America‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presidential system for her loss to Donald Trump. Hillary was asked to imagine the first female president and what words of advice she would have for her. ‚ÄoeRead my book,‚Äù Clinton said first, plugging her money-making venture. ‚ÄoeI want her to fully understand what she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s getting herself into,‚Äù she said, ‚Äoebecause it is unlike any experience she has ever had before.‚Äù She went on, ‚ÄoeOur system in our country is the most difficult political environment in the world of any democracy to elect a leader. ‚ÄoeIf you look at a lot of the women who have become heads of government in the UK, Chancellor Merkel in Germany, Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, Benazir Bhutto‚Ä" if you look at the names that we know well over the course of the last 50, 60 years, they often arise from a parliamentary system,‚Äù Clinton said. Ganghi was assassinated by her own bodyguards in 1984. Bhutto was assassinated in 2007. Hillary went on to argue that they come from small districts, are well-known to their neighbors and don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have an intense national spotlight put upon them. ‚ÄoeAnd then you are selected by your peers to be their leader, so again, your colleagues who are in your party in a parliament, they see‚Äù how they perform, she said. ‚ÄoeIn our system, you start from scratch. It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter who you are, where you come from, how qualified you are, it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter,‚Äù Clinton said. ‚ÄoeYou can stand up and say, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m gonna run for president.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> And then you have to out and you have to talk to the entire country, and you have to raise a lot of money and you have to go through the gauntlet that American presidential campaigns are.‚Äù Read more.
