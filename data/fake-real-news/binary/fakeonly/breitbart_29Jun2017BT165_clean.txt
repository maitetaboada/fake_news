At the final event in the ‚ÄoeStand up for Hungary!‚Äù series and national consultation, Prime Minister Orb√°n told Hungarians: ‚ÄoeWe shall not let Soros have the last laugh.‚Äù Stating that one of the two ‚Äoehistorical‚Äù debates placing strains on the continent are mass migration, he said the other was the future of Europe as a supranational union, which will either become ‚Äoethe Europe of Brussels or the Europe of nations.‚Äù ‚ÄoeWe are in the midst of two debates, the outcomes of which can determine Europe ‚Ä" irreversibly, and permanently,‚Äù he said. ‚Ä" EU migrant redistribution is ‚Äoethe Everest of demented ideas‚Äù ‚Ä" Calling the migrant quota system ‚Äoethe Everest of demented ideas‚Äù, he slammed German ‚Äoemultikulti‚Äù as a ‚Äoespectacular failure‚Äù and rejected the EU‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wisdom that the rest of the union should pay for German Chancellor Angela Merkel‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s open door policy. Hungary, with fellow Visegr√°d nations Poland and the Czech Republic, reject the forced redistribution of Middle Eastern and African migrants, standing up to threats of sanctions from the bloc, with Poland and the Czech Republic saying that taking migrants would be worse than EU penalties. The leader of the conservative Fidesz party, who has built border walls and recruited more guards to protect Europe from further incursions, stood by the Hungarian people‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right to decide who should be allowed in the country. ‚Ä" Soros, the ‚Äoekingmaker‚Äù of the European Union ‚Ä" Saying ‚Äoethere is almost complete consensus that we must protect the sovereignty of‚Ä¶ our migration policy from the interventions of Brussels‚Äù, he slammed the ‚ÄoeBrussels kingdom‚Äù, and its ‚Äoekingmaker‚Äù, the open borders financier Soros. Mr. Orb√°n called Soros a ‚Äoedetermined and successful money man who thinks himself a superior being‚Äù, adding the billionaire wants one million migrants to settle in Europe every year. ‚ÄoeThis would be achieved by force, if needs be ‚Ä" even against the express wishes of the European people,‚Äù the prime minister said. The Fidesz leader called Soros a ‚Äoespeculator operating an extensive mafia network, who is threatening Europe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s peace and future‚Äù, alluding to reports of NGOs working with criminal people smuggling gangs. Saying that for the globalist hedge fund manager migration is a good business, the premier said it would be even better business ‚Äoeif we stopped resisting‚Äù. ‚ÄoeThe reason [Soros] is so angry with Hungary ‚Ä" and me personally ‚Ä" is that we stand in the way of his grand plan and his grand business project.‚Äù Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban delivers his speech in front of the National Museum of Budapest on March 15, 2015 during the official commemoration of the 167th anniversary of the 1848-1849 Hungarian revolution and independence war.

He also charged the Hungarian native of attempting to remove Fidesz from power to install a government in Hungary which ‚Äoedances to his tune‚Äù, dismantles the fence, and opens the borders to illegal immigrants. ‚ÄoeWe are on the side of the Hungarian people, and the Hungarian people support the Government against Brussels and Soros,‚Äù he remarked, closing his speech with: ‚ÄoeGo for it Hungary, Go for it Hungarians!‚Äù
