MONTREAL ‚Ä" Air Canada‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s new loyalty program will allow passengers to collect 100 points every time they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re bumped from a flight and abandoned overnight at an airport. The Montreal-based carrier made the announcement after parting ways with Aeroplan, which did not offer any benefits for being left by yourself in a strange terminal to sleep on small, uncomfortable seats. ‚ÄoeWe want to reward passengers for their devotion to our business while they wait on hold for hours to hear from a customer service representative,‚Äù announced Amil Sigel from Air Canada Corporate Rewards. ‚ÄoeWe call these benefits ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Patient Passenger Points.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Clients should be rewarded for not being given a hotel and meal voucher.‚Äù Crying yourself to sleep in a vacant airport boarding area is not the only way Air Canada passengers can collect points. ‚ÄoeWe are offering 5 points for every hour your flight is delayed and an additional 15 points if you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re already on the plane, 20 points for every piece of luggage that gets lost, 25 points for every hidden surcharge, and 50 points for a cancelled flight. Oh, and 100 points if we accidentally lose your dog in cargo.‚Äù Customers may redeem their points after obtaining their first 1,000,000 points in exchange for a set of free Air Canada headphones. Certain conditions do apply and points expire every two years. Tags: Aeroplan, Air Canada, airport terminal, bumping passengers
