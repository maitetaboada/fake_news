It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take much to set off the entitled brats of the left, and that has proven to be the case most recently. As it turns out, one specific item that is frequently seen for sale all across the country has now been banned in Oregon ‚Ä" but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only white people who are being forced to ‚Äoekeep it off the shelves.‚Äù Liberals are out of control as their entitlement mentality has been allowed to fester over the previous 8 devastating years under Barack Obama. Of course, this has resulted in the rise of physical and verbal attacks of a true racist nature, which the left justifies as they claim to be warriors against ‚Äoecultural appropriation.‚Äù Sadly, that has most recently been demonstrated in Portland, Oregon, where two women, Kali Wilgus and Liz ‚ÄoeLC‚Äù Connelly, opened a food truck. According to Daily Caller, it seems that their skin wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the right color for the so-called ‚Äoeprogressives‚Äù of our nation, and the pair has since been forced to close their doors for good because of it. It all started when the duo took a road trip to Puerto Nuevo, Mexico, where they had some lobster on the beach for $5. However, what they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see coming was the delicious tortillas that were also included, and the best part is, they were unlimited. Not only did the duo fall in love with the delicious tortillas, but they set out to learn the recipe and started by asking those who made it. Although the eatery employees told them the basic ingredients, they wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t divulge the preparation process citing ‚Äoetrade secrets.‚Äù Undeterred, the two ambitious girls watched closely, and after a bit of trial and error, they were able to successfully recreate the buttery, flaky tortillas before returning home to open a food truck and sell them. Of course, they sold tacos and burritos out of a truck they named ‚ÄoeKooks‚Äù ‚Ä" but then came an article written by Willamette Week, meant to raise a little awareness about the duos endeavor. Unfortunately, the liberal social justice warriors quickly came out of the woodwork. Worst of all came a blogger by the name of Jagger Blaec : Saying that the girls ‚Äoestole‚Äù the recipe, which they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t, in an article written for Portland Mercury, Jagger would later say that Kali and LC were appropriating the customs of ‚Äoebrown people‚Äù in order to erase, exploit, and, of course, profit off of what they brought back with them. Now, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know about you, but that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not exactly what I got from all this. I see two ambitious girls who found something they liked, wanted to share it with others, learned to make it, and decided to make a little money off of it. In the end, they live over 1,000 miles away from where they initially discovered the hidden gem, meaning that they weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stealing anyone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s business. No one is going to drive over 18 hours for a taco from a food truck. However, after the abuse from the left, Kooks announced that they would be closing their doors ‚Ä" a notion which Jagger applauded, but this entitled blogger couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be more wrong about anything she wrote. People all across the globe do what these two girls did. They found a recipe they liked and tried to replicate it or maybe improve on it, so they could sell it themselves. This is America ‚Ä" welcome to capitalism. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like it? Leave. You can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even legally patent a tortilla recipe for crying out loud. You know why? Because it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not individual or unique. There are hundreds of people all across the globe making some variety of the recipe, meaning that no one has singular rights to make them. In fact, one commenter made the point perfectly when he wrote: ‚ÄoeAre you all suggesting that Andy Ricker close Pok Pok? Should John Gorham close Toro Bravo? ‚Ä¶ If learning how to make a food from another culture and selling it is now considered cultural appropriation, then why not take this issue up with the successful PDX businesses that have been doing this at a much larger scale for years, and stop harassing these two women struggling to start a small business.‚Äù [Source: Mic] The fact of the matter here is that everyone does this in the food industry. Furthermore, attacking two people because they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re a smaller target than the big industries that do it on a national scale makes you look like the bully bad guy ‚Ä" not the other way around.
