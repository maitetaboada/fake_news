President Donald Trump recently embarked on his first foreign trip as Commander-in-Chief, traveling from Saudi Arabia to Sicily. While there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been plenty to report, social media users noticed something amiss during his trip. Trump has been known to say whatever he pleases, especially on social media. However, since embarking on his trip overseas, things have been quite different. His Twitter account has been much more silent than his followers are used to. Thank you for such a wonderful and unforgettable visit, Prime Minister and . ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 23, 2017 Thank you for the warm welcome to Brussels, Belgium this afternoon! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 24, 2017 Although there have been a few tweets on his account, they appear to have been posted by a White House staffer rather than Trump himself. In fact, only 16 tweets have been posted since his trip began last Friday, most of which are only clips of his speeches or a photo, merely showing what he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s doing on his trip, not likely written by Trump himself since they are missing his usual flare. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a rather clear-cut difference between Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 6 a.m. rants and snarky comments that call out the witch hunt he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s endured from the liberal left and mainstream media compared to the posts that have gone up while he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been traveling, according to Daily Caller. This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 18, 2017 Getting ready for my big foreign trip. Will be strongly protecting American interests ‚Ä" that's what I like to do! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 19, 2017 The last post that is believed to have been created by Trump himself was back on May 19th. After the Manchester bombing, Trump publicly commented on the disaster, but the only thing posted to his Twitter account was a photo with an American flag and a United Kingdom flag and the words: ‚ÄoeWe stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom.‚Äù We stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom. ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 23, 2017 While many are missing the transparency our Commander-in-Chief has created with his use of social media to speak directly to the people, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shown that when there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s real work to be done, he gets it done and places less important things secondary. Not only were his tweets missing during this important trip, so were the apologies that former President Barack Obama liked to offer ‚Ä" and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a good thing. While Obama bowed down to the rest of the world, weakening our standing on the world stage, Trump is definitely taking a different approach ‚Ä" and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s refreshing. President Donald Trump just put the United States back at the head of the table as he continues to make America great again. So, the liberals are just going to have to wait until he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s back in Washington, D.C., to find something on his Twitter account to attack.
