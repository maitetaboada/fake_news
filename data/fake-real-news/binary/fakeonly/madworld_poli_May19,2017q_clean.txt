Trump-hating former FBI Director James Comey woke up to a nasty surprise Friday, May 19, 2017, as a few government officials who are fed up with his corrupt behavior revealed his shameful secret. Now, the disgraced former bureau chief will need to find a hole in the sand big enough to fit his head and his damaged ego. According to TownHall, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with members of the House of Representatives Friday to discuss Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dismissal. The importance of Rosenstein‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s briefing can not be overstated as he was Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s former boss and the person ultimately responsible for the FBI Director‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s conduct. Rosenstein went straight for the jugular in his remarks, telling the representatives he was dismayed by Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s press conference from July 2016 during which he ‚Äoeusurped‚Äù the Department of Justice in a very self-aggrandizing manner. At that time, Comey revealed his ‚Äoefindings‚Äù from the investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s illegal server, telling Congress that ‚Äoeno reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.‚Äù Rosenstein further told representatives that he was frustrated with Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s decision to circumvent the DoJ‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s authority by sending a letter to Congress 11 days before the 2016 election, advising them that he was reopening the investigation. Rosenstein summation of Comey being in love with himself and the power of his office goes hand-in-hand with Congressman Darrell Issa‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s (R-CA) statement to reporters following his meeting with the Deputy Attorney General, according to Daily Caller. ‚ÄoeI, for one, thought that Comey ill-served the American people when he tried to stretch beyond all reason the Fourth Amendment to hack into your iPhones,‚Äù Issa declared. ‚ÄoeSo I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve had a belief that he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t respect the Constitution, had become in love with the camera ‚Ä" which is normally for politicians,‚Äù Issa continued, ‚Äoeand that he began thinking that he was somehow larger than the FBI director and effectively being the FBI Director and the Department of Justice.‚Äù Obsessively in love with his own image, Comey is truly the Narcissus of our time. But, no longer can he hide behind the title of FBI Director and secretly carry out his political quest for immortality. President Donald Trump should have fired him the day he took office, and millions of American patriots were expecting just that to happen. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s letters requesting the dismissal of Comey can be read in their entirety at NBC‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Nightly News Twitter page. Both men made it clear that the DOJ and the FBI had lost confidence in Comey after his incomprehensible behavior during the Hillary Clinton investigation. In his letter, Sessions said, ‚ÄoeIt is essential that this Department of Justice clearly reaffirm its commitment to longstanding principles that ensure the integrity and fairness of federal investigations and prosecutions,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄoeThe director of the FBI must be someone who follows faithfully the rules and principles of the Department of Justice and who sets the right examples for our law enforcement officials and others in the department.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄoeTherefore, I must recommend that you remove Director James B. Comey, Jr. and identify an experienced and qualified individual to lead the great men and women of the FBI.‚Äù Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disgrace is magnified as he is only the second FBI director in America‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s history to be fired from the job. President Bill Clinton fired former FBI Director William S. Sessions, who previously served under George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. The FBI and the American people are better off without Comey. Perhaps the bureau can get back to the business of going after criminals now instead of being used as a political weapon.
