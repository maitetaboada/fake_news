Graduates of Notre Dame recently made national headlines after turning their backs and leaving before Vice President Mike Pence could start his speech. Unfortunately for the entitled brats who couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t maintain their composure for just a few minutes, a Texas cowboy just put them in their place ‚Ä" and all it took were three extremely brutal words. With the event trending on social media and just about every news source around the country, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s safe to say that students of Notre Dame were successful in what they set out to do. As seen in video footage documenting the entire ordeal, dozens of students left in public protest as Pence took the stage. Unfortunately for the misguided graduates, things haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exactly turned out the way they wanted as all the attention wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t positive by any means. In fact, it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t long before people all across America were calling them everything from disrespectful to entitled brats ‚Ä" and not too many people disagree. However, the worst of the backlash was delivered by a badass Texas cowboy, and the snotty students were in for a rude awakening. As it turns out, popular social media personality Chad Prather had a few brutal words for the childish punks, and he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t pull any punches. ‚ÄoeEmployers‚Ä¶go find the video of the college grads at Notre Dame walking out on the vice president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s commencement speech,‚Äù he said before dishing out three brutal words, followed by sound advice. ‚ÄoeRemember their faces and don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make the mistake of hiring them.‚Äù Of course, he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t done there. ‚ÄoeAs a boss, you will do and say things they disagree with and their feelings will be hurt. This is how they respond to disappointment. I have a strong feeling they will be experiencing a lot of it in the years to come,‚Äù he wrote in a Facebook post. Authority requires respect if it is to be an effective tool in civilized society. Pointing out exactly that, Chad went on to say that this is nothing more than the product of a generation that wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t properly disciplined ‚Ä" that is, if they were disciplined at all. Chad proved his point with a little example, asking what would happen if someone turned their back on a police officer in ‚Äoeprotest‚Äù after having been pulled over. As we all know, it wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t turn out too well for any idiot dumb enough to try. ‚ÄoeThis little juvenile protest demonstrates the fact that this generation has never been held accountable with consequences from their actions,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄoeIf one of my kids walked out on Joe Biden in that fashion, there would‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been hell to pay. Believe THAT!‚Äù While many on the right heavily despised former President Barack Obama, his administration, and the destructive policies he implemented on America, you never saw anything like this. Sure, you have people speaking their minds all over social media, but mass public acts of disrespect didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t come around until it was the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s turn to deal with things not going their way. Our nation is a great one, mostly because of the wide variety of opinions and people who are here. However, we all need to be able to act as civil adults because, with such variety, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to frequently experience things not going our way and a difference of opinion. Of course, if the left doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t feel like maturing, it will come back to bite them in the long run. After all, if I was an employer and saw one these kids walk in for an interview, well, I just might be persuaded to take Chad‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s advice. After all, no one wants an insubordinate brat, who thinks they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re entitled to do whatever they want, working with them, let alone for them.
