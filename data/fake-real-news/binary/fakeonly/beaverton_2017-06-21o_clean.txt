OTTAWA ‚Ä" Mere moments after a mischievous smile spread across his face at the sight of a young couple taking wedding photos, a shirtless Andrew Scheer is rolling on the ground, grovelling and squealing in anguish. ‚ÄoeHe-eeey guys!‚Äù said Scheer, peeling off his short-sleeved blue button-down shirt and throwing clammy arms around the shoulders of the happy couple. ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s me, Andrew Sche-eeaAAUUGH!‚Äù Scheer could not be reached for any further comment, other than a high-pitched wheezing sound. ‚ÄoeWow, the Leader of the Opposition,‚Äù said bride-to-be Linda Cheng, after putting away the can of mace and being told who it was she had just sprayed down. ‚ÄoeSorry, mister, I had no idea!‚Äù Although things didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go exactly according to plan, the selfie taken by the couple shortly after Scheer began throwing up has gone viral on Instagram, racking up an incredible 113 likes. ‚ÄoeHonestly, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to count this one as a win,‚Äù said Scheer PR staffer, Jillian Mitchell, washing Scheer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s eyes out with the baby shampoo she has learned to carry over the last several weeks. ‚ÄoeThis has already gone a lot better than the photo op where Andrew thought ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>kissing babies‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> meant he was supposed to do it open-mouthed.‚Äù This is just one of the first stops on Scheer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s new press tour. According to Mitchell, several ambulances are already standing by for this afternoon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attempt to perform the Mayurasana ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>peacock‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> yoga pose on the edge of a desk.
