Without a doubt, liberals can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop talking about President Donald Trump and his attempts to undo the damage caused by former President Barack Obama. However, a new license plate emerging out of California will undoubtedly leave them at a loss for words as patriots in at least 21 other states are putting these on their vehicles. Greg Cooper, an Attorney in California, was the first of many drivers who raced to his local Department of Motor Vehicles to claim a new license plate inspired by the President of the United States. In fact, when social media users learned exactly what he planned on putting on his plates, many loved the idea so much that they decided to follow suit. It all began with Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoecovfefe‚Äù tweet, where he wrote something on Twitter that made heads turn. In fact, Cooper thought it was so hilarious that he decided to make his own statement by getting a license plate that reads, ‚Äoecovfefe.‚Äù My dad just bought the CA license plate "COVFEFE." #covfefe ‚Ä" Talya Cooper () May 31, 2017 When Cooper‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s daughter, Tayla, saw his new plate design, she instantly took a photo and posted it to Twitter. The post has since received over 97,000 likes and has been retweeted over 20,000 times, although Cooper says he ‚Äoehas not decided whether he will attach the license plate to his car when it arrives in 12 weeks,‚Äù according to Breitbart. However, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the only one who had the same idea, so even if he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t affix it to his car, many of the others who got one most certainly will. 'COVFEFE' vanity license plate claimed 5 hours after Trump tweeted it 0 ‚Ä" Lincoln Journal Star () June 1, 2017 Drivers across the country have also claimed their ‚Äoecovfefe‚Äù plates. In fact, the plate has already been taken in California, North Carolina, Maine, and Nebraska ‚Ä" among several others. One man from Nebraska, Evan Milton, claimed his state‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoecovfefe‚Äù plate for just $40, five hours after Trump tweeted the word at approximately 4 a.m. ‚Ä" talk about commitment. However, he only made that quick decision because he had already wanted a vanity plate on his car that came from a meme. Trump himself found the entire thing comical. In a follow-up tweet, he poked fun at his own apparent mishap, saying, ‚ÄoeWho can figure out the true meaning of ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>covfefe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>??? Enjoy!‚Äù As Mad World News has previously reported, the tweet‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s code was eventually translated from Arabic into English, with many claiming ‚Äoecovfefe‚Äù (cov fe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> fe) means ‚ÄoeI will stand up,‚Äù according to Google Translate at the time, although it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been heavily debated since. Many say that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not what he meant, however, it would make sense in context; ‚ÄoeDespite the constant negative press, I will stand up.‚Äù Who can figure out the true meaning of "covfefe" ??? Enjoy! ‚Ä" Donald J. Trump () May 31, 2017 Perhaps these people have the right idea and have officially marked their vehicles with a piece of history. In fact, as of Monday afternoon, there were seven states where drivers can still order a ‚Äoecovfefe‚Äù vanity plate. If you want to have one of your own, you better hurry before your chance is up. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a good thing President Donald Trump and some people in our country have a sense of humor. Regardless as to whether his tweet was purposeful or accidental, it managed to get everyone talking, and there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nothing better than a nation who can laugh together in good fun.
