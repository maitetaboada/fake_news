President Donald Trump has long been a huge supporter of our troops, even before he ran for political office. That fact hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t changed since he became Commander-in-Chief, either. Trump spent Monday observing Memorial Day, giving a speech in which he paused, looked directly at the widow of a fallen soldier, and uttered five words she will surely never forget. ‚ÄoeHere at this hallowed shrine we honor the noblest among us ‚Ä" the men and the women who paid the ultimate price for victory and for freedom,‚Äù Trump told a crowd of families, military personnel, and dignitaries at Arlington National Cemetery. ‚ÄoeWe pay tribute to those brave souls who raced into gunfire, roared into battle, and ran into hell to face down evil. They made their sacrifice not for fame or for money or even for glory, but for country,‚Äù he added, according to CNN. Among those whose stories President Trump shared was Army Specialist Christopher Horton, an Oklahoma Army Guard member who died in Afghanistan during his deployment in 2011. He was just 26-years-old. ‚ÄoeChris sacrificed his life to protect his fellow soldiers and to protect all Americans. Chris secured his place in our hearts for eternity,‚Äù Trump said before turning to the fallen soldier‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s widow, Jane. ‚ÄoeJane: America grieves with you,‚Äù he added. Indeed, on this day of solemn remembrance, Americans from sea to shining sea grieve with the loved ones of the fallen, like Jane Horton, who has been left to carry on without her beloved husband. In a moment reminiscent of the tribute Trump paid to Carryn Owens, the widow of fallen Navy SEAL William ‚ÄoeRyan‚Äù Owens during his very first address to a joint session of Congress, the president looked up at Ms. Horton after concluding his story, and said simply, ‚ÄoeThank you, Jane.‚Äù As she wiped a tear from her eye, the crowd offered her a standing ovation, much the same way they had done for Ms. Owens. Trump also singled out Gen. John Kelly, his Homeland Security chief, for having lost his son, Robert, who died fighting the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>enemies of all civilizations‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> in Afghanistan. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>We grieve with you, we honor you, and we pledge to you that we will always remember Robert and what he did for all of us,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> the president said. Robert Kelly was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Helmand province in 2010 at the age of 29. Trump said Kelly was joined by his son-in-law, Jake, a wounded warrior.

For these American heroes, we offer our deepest respect and gratitude. We are forever indebted to them.
