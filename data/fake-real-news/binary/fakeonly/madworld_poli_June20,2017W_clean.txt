South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy was recently speaking to a group of students when a brainwashed 13-year-old confronted him with 3 ugly liberal lies about herself. Watch as the ‚Äoebulldog‚Äù reveals one shocking truth about his own daughter in order to help the misguided student get back on track. Forty Junior High students from the Greenwood School District in Greenwood, Arkansas, were given the opportunity to attend the 2nd installment of the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Distinguished Lecture Series at the Fort Smith Convention Center on April 20, 2017, according to their Facebook page, but one particular clip is just now gaining traction on the internet. As South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy addressed the audience of young bright minds, one misguided youngster asked him to address three liberal lies about her generation and his response was truly epic. In the YouTube video, the student began her question by saying, ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m Eden Adams. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m thirteen and I go to Greenwood Junior High. As young people, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re known as Generation iY for being afloat with no real aim, arrogant with no real confidence, and entitled. We want to earn back our reputation and prove our critics wrong. Help us do that. How can we impact politics and make a difference that matters without waiting until we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re old enough to vote?‚Äù It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s admirable that the 13-year-old student would ask Gowdy for help with these crucial concerns, and he immediately handles the most important aspect of her inquiry when he replied, ‚ÄoeWell, let me just say you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re none of those things you just said.‚Äù Gowdy realized that he was dealing with a student who had been indoctrinated with one of the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s most evil ideas ‚Ä" American shame. The progressives in America want to see our nation diminished into a third world commune built on a lack of individual exceptionalism and redistribution of wealth. What better way to brainwash American children than to drive them to hopelessness with falsehoods about their personal character. Gowdy continued to destroy this liberal load of bull by saying, ‚ÄoeI want to compliment your generation. I have a daughter that is just a little bit older than you are and your generation is understanding of people‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s differences and you are more inclusive than my generation ever was. So, I think you all are doing great. If you want to do even greater, access information is what I would tell you if you were my child. You can believe what you want but you have to be able to explain to me why you believe it.‚Äù These days, kids don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hear this kind of common sense from adults. Mostly, they turn on the T.V. and see liberal politicians constantly attacking our hard working president and creating drama where there should be none. Gowdy gets that and doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t waste this opportunity to make a lasting impression on these students. Gowdy continued on to open up and share a very genuine experience from his own family ‚ÄoeSo, for my daughter who briefly flirted with Bernie fever; parenting mistake on my behalf. But, what I told her was you can believe whatever you want. You just have to be able to tell me why. So when you hear the word ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>free‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> you just understand that that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the right word. It may be free to you but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not free,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄoeSo educate yourself. Understand that there are always three or four different positions on almost every seminal issue of the day. And don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ever stop asking the question, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Why?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Your generation, to me, does a much better job than my generation, and I truly mean that.‚Äù I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t agree more with Gowdy. American kids need to be spoken to in a direct common sense manner. It was ironic that the 13-year-old girl recited three characteristics more accurately attributed to liberals than anyone else. ‚ÄoeAfloat with no real aim, arrogant with no real confidence, and entitled.‚Äù What an accurate description of progressives in our country. Perhaps, that should be the campaign slogan for the next Democrat who runs for president. Thank God for guys like Gowdy who are actively telling kids they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to fulfill this despicable vision by the left.
