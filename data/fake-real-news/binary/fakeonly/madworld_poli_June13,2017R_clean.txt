Although it has been a full year since the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich, it seems that a man who claims to have witnessed the horrific ordeal just came forward. Unfortunately for those responsible for Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s death, things just got worse than they could ever imagine as the witness dropped one shocking detail that no one saw coming. Mad World News has reported several times on the Seth Rich case after it was exposed that he was likely the one responsible for the DNC email leaks. Of course, seeing how what he did hurt Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign and so many other people close to the Clinton family have been found under suspicious circumstances in the past, it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t long before people started asking questions. Even more shocking was the fact that the local police force wanted to brush the entire incident under the rug, quickly labeling it a robbery and moving on. However, when you take into consideration that the guy was shot in the back and still had his watch, cell phone, and wallet, things don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t add up. One year later, a witness who claims to have been there at the time just dropped one shocking detail that changes everything. According to The Gateway Pundit, ‚ÄoeA new video has emerged of a man named ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Mark Mueller,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> who could possibly be using the alias ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Scott Roberts,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> claiming to be Seth Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s neighbor.‚Äù The man claims he saw Rich‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s body after he was shot and said that the DNC staffer ‚Äoedidn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even know he was shot.‚Äù Alleged eyewitness to Seth Rich's murder says 'they walked him past me and he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even know he was shot‚Ä"no pain.' u ‚Ä" Josh Caplan () June 12, 2017 In short, he was executed and didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even realize what had happened. The remarks were made at a vigil in remembrance for Seth Rich where Debbie Wasserman Schultz was also in attendance. ‚ÄoeI was there when he (Seth Rich) got shot and they walked him past me so that I could see him and identify him because I knew him in the neighborhood, and the police officer said, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even know he was shot,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>‚Äù Mark explained at the time. ‚ÄoeSo, if it gives you any comfort, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think he had any pain physically.‚Äù However, this puts the entire narrative in question as police say they found Seth Rich ‚Äoeconscious and breathing.‚Äù Furthermore, three officers who responded were wearing body cameras at the time, but each of the videos has miraculously gone missing for some reason. Now, anyone with a lick of common sense would be able to tell you that things just don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t add up here on several different levels. However, police seem sure that they have things all figured out and have adamantly told the public to stop looking into it. In this day and age, the last thing you can do when someone comes out and says, ‚Äoetrust me,‚Äù is take them on their word. For some reason, honesty is a rare quality to find in people these days ‚Ä" especially those in a position of power. So, when this guy says just 5 words that blow apart the narrative we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been force fed for an entire year, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only natural to start looking a bit deeper, and hopefully, just that will happen with this unofficial testimony now out there for everyone to see and hear. Seth Rich and his family deserve justice ‚Ä" and so do the vile punks responsible for such an atrocity.
