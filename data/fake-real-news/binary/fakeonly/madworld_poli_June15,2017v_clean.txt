Although the left has been using the recent shooting in Virginia as an attempt to take away even more rights from the American people, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s clear that not everyone shares their sentiments. In fact, liberals and their lapdog, leftist media have been working hard to hide what President Donald Trump did just moments after the shooting ‚Ä" but the secret was just blown wide open. As most of the world is aware, Republicans were practicing for an upcoming charity baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia, when gunshots rang out. When the dust had settled, the shooter, James T. Hodgkinson III, had shot and injured 5 people including Rep. Steve Scalise before he was killed by Capitol Police. Since then, the left has been responsible for an inappropriate and unacceptable amount of vitriol, not only expressing their belief that Republicans ‚Äoegot what they deserved‚Äù but that ‚ÄoeTrump should have been shot‚Äù as well. Along with that, Democrats are trying to use the tragedy to strip Americans of their Second Amendment rights. As one would imagine, leftist propaganda networks like CNN and MSNBC have been working tirelessly to spin the events in a way that can benefit their liberal agenda. Making matters worse, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re also making sure to ignore aspects of the story that aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t convenient or will implode their narrative entirely. In fact, one such instance has just come to light which involved none other than President Trump himself. As it turns out, the president made sure to do one thing after the shooting ‚Ä" and the leftist mainstream media does not want you to know about it. According to The Daily Caller, the secret is now out that ‚ÄoeDonald and Melania Trump made an unannounced visit to the Washington hospital where Rep. Steve Scalise is being treated Wednesday night after he was gunned down during a congressional baseball practice earlier that day.‚Äù Now, we all know that networks like CNN and MSNBC want to demonize Trump at every turn, but the president is surely giving them a run for their money on this one. The pool report indicates that the president and first lady were spotted with bouquets of flowers at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center. In all, they spent about half an hour speaking to the victims and even stopped by to thank the Capitol Police who were injured as well. Their departure from the hospital was captured on video and later shared by Red State Watcher. When it comes down to it, this instance is a disaster for the left no matter how hard they try to spin it. Not only did good guys with guns take out a liberal terrorist, but Trump is going above and beyond the duties of his office in a way that wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have been seen during former President Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tenure. Trump has put the liberal establishment to shame, and he continues to do so at every turn. At this point, the left may just want to throw in the towel and get in line because all they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re doing is making complete and utter fools of themselves the longer they continue to act this way. Not to mention, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s their rhetoric encouraging this type of terroristic behavior in the first place. Their whole party is going down the drain, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all their fault at this point.
