With liberals already in an uproar all across the country, some may think that President Donald Trump and his administration might lay low to avoid further controversy, but they would be wrong. In fact, Vice President Mike Pence just pissed off a few more liberals by dishing out a nasty slap in the face to Muslims everywhere ‚Ä" and it took just 4 words to do it. Although most of the news cycle has been dedicated to Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s recent firing of now-former FBI Director James Comey, it seems that his second-in-command just made liberal heads spin even more while speaking at the World Summit In Defense of Persecuted Christians. Organized by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA), the gathering was intended for just what its name suggests ‚Ä" to confront the growing threat against Christianity worldwide. With influential religious leaders from around the world in attendance, including delegations from Russia, Syria, and Egypt, Christians from Protestant and Roman Catholic denominations in America used the platform to expose the reality that the liberal mainstream media wants to ignore. Of those in attendance was Vice President Mike Pence, who was invited to make a speech where he managed to dish a brutal blow to Muslims everywhere. As heard in a video posted to WhiteHouse.gov, Pence boldly declared that no group faces ‚Äoegreater hostility or hatred‚Äù than Christians. As we all know, Muslims and liberals alike claim that the followers of Islam are the most persecuted, hoping to garner sympathy for the religion that produces more terrorists than any other. Unfortunately for them, their ‚Äoealternative fact‚Äù clearly isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the case. In fact, Pence went on to state that Muslims are most likely the greatest threat to Christianity around the entire globe. ‚ÄoeThe [Christian] faith is under siege,‚Äù Pence told the audience of around 600 people, particularly by ISIS and radical Islamic terrorists. Across the world, ‚Äoeover 215 million Christians confront intimidation, imprisonment, forced conversion, abuse, assault, and worse for holding to the truths of the Gospel,‚Äù Pence said. The decline of Christianity in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere in Middle East, where ‚Äoethe messages of our Lord were first uttered,‚Äù must be addressed, Pence continued. Extremist groups like ISIS and Boko Haram ‚Äoeseek to stamp out any religions that are not their own‚Äù and harbor a particular hatred of Christians, according to Pence. ‚ÄoeI believe ISIS is guilty of nothing short of genocide against people of the Christian faith, and it is time the world called it by name,‚Äù he said. [Source: Daily Caller] When all is said and done, the left has done a pretty good job at hiding the true horrors of the world. Not only were they successful in covering up the massive genocide of Christians around the globe, but they managed to make the group responsible for such a slaughter look like the victims. Unfortunately for the whining left and Muslims alike, though, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a new sheriff in town ‚Ä" and this one would much rather tell the harsh truth over spewing lies under the guise of ‚Äoepolitical correctness.‚Äù In fact, all the world is seeing from the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tactics, of avoiding confrontation or offending anyone, are people dying because of their false narratives. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nice to see someone in charge that isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t afraid to pull up his sleeves and get to work ‚Ä" and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s even better knowing that everyone around him has the same work ethic as well. The times of lies and deceit are over. The left can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hide from the truth anymore.
