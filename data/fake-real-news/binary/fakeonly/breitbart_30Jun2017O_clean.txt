The video is the latest that O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Keefe and Project Veritas have dropped this week targeting CNN, as the embattled network struggles with diminished credibility and wide perceptions of anti-Trump bias. The producer in question is identified in the video as Jimmy Carr, who apparently works on CNN‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s morning show, New Day. It is not clear when or where Carr‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s statements were recorded, but on Project Veritas‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> hidden camera, he is shown disparaging Trump as a fraudulent candidate who does not believe in, or care about, the principles he espouses. Carr is also recorded telling a Project Veritas journalist that his anti-Trump views are shared by the vast majority of people he works with at CNN. ‚ÄoeOn the inside, we all recognize he is a clown, that he is hilariously unqualified for this, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really bad at this, and that he does not have America‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s best interests ‚Ä¶ We recognize he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just f*cking crazy,‚Äù Carr states in the video. He adds: ‚Äoe90% of us are on board with just the fact that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s crazy.‚Äù The Project Veritas undercover journalist also asks: ‚ÄoeWould it be fair to question the intellect of the American voter?‚Äù Carr responds: ‚ÄoeOh, no. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re stupid as sh*t.‚Äù Later in the video, Carr goes on to disparage Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign manager, and White House adviser, Kellyann Conway: ‚ÄoeShe looks like she got hit with a shovel.‚Äù The video is the fourth part of Project Veritas‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚ÄoeAmerican Pravda‚Äù series. The first reveals a CNN producer disparaging the network‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s running story on purported collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign as ‚Äoemostly bullsh*t.‚Äù The second video appears to show left-wing CNN commentator Van Jones calling the Russia controversy a ‚Äoenothing burger.‚Äù In Part 3, O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Keefe claims in a tweet that CNN CEO Jeff Zucker refused to respond to his questions about CNN‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s coverage of the Russia story.
