Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ex-girlfriend Genevieve Cook is clearing the air about their intimate relationship, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s quite a bombshell. Cook dated Obama for over a year when Barack was twenty-two, and she kept journal entries that back up all her memories. Cook opened up, giving new information about the 44th president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sexual relationships. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss this. Cook relayed to Obama biographer David Maraniss that Barack was uncomfortable with intimacy. Cook wrote that in their relationship, ‚Äoethe sexual warmth is definitely there ‚Ä" but the rest of it has sharp edges.‚Äù Today, she remembers ‚Äoefeeling anger‚Äù at Obama, whose ‚Äoewarmth can be deceptive.‚Äù She builds on his coldness to allude to other issues, and this is definitely not something his campaign would have ever wanted anyone to know when he was running for president. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only now that Obama is out of the presidency that Cook felt she would not be in danger for disclosing personal details. ‚ÄoeThough he speaks sweet words, there is also that coolness,‚Äù she recalled. Cook is being generous. What she is saying is that Obama is a cold bastard, she speaks of his caring nature, but like a snake, there was nothing but cold dead eyes. Telegraph reported, ‚ÄoeHer journal recalled a 22-year-old man who wore ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>a comfy T-shirt depicting buxom women,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and was marked by the smells of ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>running sweat, Brut spray deodorant, smoking, eating raisins, sleeping, breathing.'‚Äù Ms. Cook ‚Äoeengaged [Mr. Obama] in the deepest romantic relationship of his young life,‚Äù Maraniss writes, but they separated in 1985. Reflecting on the ‚Äoeemotional scarring‚Äù that made him hard to get close to, she wrote at the time, ‚ÄoeI guess I hoped time would change things, and he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d let go and ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>fall in love‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> with me.‚Äù Cook‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s take is in direct opposition to Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own reflections on their relationship, and she is clear, Obama was lying all throughout his bogus book ‚ÄoeDreams From My Father.‚Äù But, the real bombshell Cook relayed has been often dismissed or conveniently overlooked. Cook and another Obama girlfriend, Alex McNear, both hint at his inability to connect intimately and his obsession with his Pakistani friends. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s odd. This one thing about his Pakistani friends is something that two women say he was really pondering in his twenties. McNear put it like this: ‚ÄoeAs the multiracial product of an international upbringing, he complained of being ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>caught without a class, a structure, or tradition to support me‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and envying the clearly defined lives of Pakistani friends.‚Äù Cook too talks about Barack‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚ÄoePaki buddies,‚Äù so who were these men and what was it about them that dominated Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s thoughts? Obama took a trip to Pakistan with his college roommate, Mohammed Hasan Chandoo, in 1981, but his 2008 campaign kept this trip under wraps. It was so secret that when Obama made a gaffe and mentioned it while on the campaign trail, his handlers went into panic mode. Whatever happened in Pakistan was a game changer, and if the media would have done their jobs back then, he never would have won. Obama left it out of his autobiography, and to this day, the rumors are Obama was engaged in a homosexual relationship while there. He also had a lot of Pakistani college friends at Columbia. You guessed right, these were all Muslims, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fascination with them and their strict Muslim lives that is so strange. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s possible these men were homosexuals, as Daily Mail reports, ‚ÄoeObama wrote somewhat elusively to his first intimate girlfriend that he had thought about and considered gayness but ultimately decided that a same-sex relationship would be less challenging and demanding than developing one with the opposite sex.‚Äù Why does any of this matter now? The truth always matters. Barack Obama became the most powerful man in the world as the President of the United States and he brought a lot of grief to America because the media refused to vet him properly. Where there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s smoke, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fire, and the underlying theme of Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s twenties were relationships with homosexual men. This is why it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s imperative that Americans never again trust the mainstream media. They got Obama elected twice, taking our country and throwing it to the liberal wolves who almost ruined it for good. Thank God, Donald Trump stood up and was willing to serve. We can see why he is adamant about calling out the liberal media because they can be the most dangerous thing in the world.
