A new report has been released after President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence had dinner with Time Magazine reporters. What happened during the meal has resulted in the rise of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s newest ‚Äoescandal,‚Äù and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve uncovered what has caused the ridiculous uproar from the left. When you become president, you get a few extras that the average American doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. For example, you get your own kitchen staff who will adhere to your tastes and preferences in food. Apparently, while a few Time Magazine reporters were in the White House for dinner with President Trump and Vice President Pence, they witnessed Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoeselfishness,‚Äù and it stemmed from what was seen on his dessert plate. Of course, as soon as Time Magazine got the opportunity, they released an article to let Americans know about our supposedly selfish Commander-in-Chief. According to The Gateway Pundit, the article read: The waiters know well Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s personal preferences. As he settles down, they bring him a Diet Coke, while the rest of us are served water, with the Vice President sitting at one end of the table. With the salad course, Trump is served what appears to be Thousand Island dressing instead of the creamy vinaigrette for his guests. When the chicken arrives, he is the only one given an extra dish of sauce. At the dessert course, he gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, instead of the single scoop for everyone else. The tastes of Pence are also tended to. Instead of the pie, he gets a fruit plate. Seriously? They think that the worst thing the President of the United States can do is to have an extra scoop of ice cream with his dessert. Somehow, the number of ice cream scoops that Trump is served is not only newsworthy to liberal outlets but it has become an excuse for them to attack him. Liberals have truly stooped to a new low. this is the most dickish thing I have ever read ‚Ä" Daniel Summers () May 11, 2017 Note: in new, very good Bio, Nixon was always served very good wine‚Ä¶ the rest of the staff got cheap wine. It's good to be king. ‚Ä" Grady Forrer () May 11, 2017 a man unable to restrain his urges ‚Ä" Jennifer Rubin () May 11, 2017 Clearly, leftists in our nation need a reality check. When the worst thing you can find to attack your president over is what he eats for dessert, he isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a bad president. It actually says more about the mainstream media than it does Trump as they prove the fact that they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re childish. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to grow up, do what you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re paid to do, and inform the country about important news, not about what the president is ingesting. The media is just obsessed with demonizing Donald Trump. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nothing wrong with the idea that the kitchen workers at the White House have catered to the tastes of the president and vice president. In fact, it should be expected, and the fact that these ‚Äoejournalists‚Äù even started talking about it is ridiculous.
