Although now-former FBI Director James Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s abrupt termination had to have hit him hard, it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the worst news he could possibly get. Unfortunately for him, he was sadly mistaken if he thought it was over as he got some more bad news just 2 days later ‚Ä" and now, his world is falling apart. Liberals have been going just about berserk since Comey was fired. However, all they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve really done is exposed their bias and pathetic stubbornness to the world, seeing how they were the first ones to call for the man to resign or be fired just a few months ago. Of course, now that it has happened at the hands of Trump, the left is crying foul ‚Ä" but not too many people are buying into it except for, well, the liberals themselves. As it turns out, though, they may want to buckle up because they are in for a bumpy ride if they thought Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s termination was bad. In fact, things are going to get a lot worse after what just happened. According to The Gateway Pundit, FBI agents who are furious with Comey are ready to come forward, and even better yet, they ‚Äoeare going to talk.‚Äù As it turns out, several of his subordinates did not approve of the way he irresponsibly dealt with Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s email scandal, and now that they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to fear his retaliation, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re ready to tell all. ‚ÄoeThis is a textbook case where a grand jury should have convened but was not. That is appalling,‚Äù an FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases said of the decision. ‚ÄoeWe talk about it in the office and don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know how Comey can keep going.‚Äù The agent was also surprised that the bureau did not bother to search Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house during the investigation. ‚ÄoeWe didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t search their house. We always search the house. The search should not just have been for private electronics, which contained classified material, but even for printouts of such material,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄoeThere should have been a complete search of their residence,‚Äù the agent pointed out. ‚ÄoeThat the FBI did not seize devices is unbelievable. The FBI even seizes devices that have been set on fire.‚Äù [Source: Daily Caller] From the looks of things, Comey most certainly did not fulfill the duties of his position when it comes to Hillary‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s case, leading many to wonder how many other times he was able to do that and fly under the radar. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve already seen that former President Barack Obama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lap dog in the DOJ, ex-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, made drastic efforts to cover for Hillary, and now, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re seeing that she wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t alone. In fact, it was a widespread effort to keep the then-presidential hopeful out of trouble. However, things may be far from over with Comey out of the way, and everyone responsible should be shaking in their boots right about now. ‚ÄoePeople are starting to talk. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re calling their former friends outside the bureau, asking for help,‚Äù Washington, D.C., attorney Joe DiGenova said. ‚ÄoeWe were asked today to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away. The most important thing of all is that the agents have decided that they are going to talk.‚Äù The truth always has a funny way of coming out. Although the crooks in D.C. might not have had that fear with Barack Obama as president, the White House is being run a bit differently these days. The whole ‚Äoeyou scratch my back, I scratch yours‚Äù style of corruption is coming to an end one way or another ‚Ä" and as we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve most recently seen, if you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t comply willingly, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be removed from the equation altogether. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to drain the swamp.
