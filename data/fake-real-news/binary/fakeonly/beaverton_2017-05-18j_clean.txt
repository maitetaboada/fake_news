Every week Beaverton editor-in-chief Luke Gordon Field assembles some of the countryâ€<sup>TM</sup>s best comedians and writers to talk, mock and riff their way through the news of the week. Then he puts their knowledge to the test in a very important quiz where the winner gets absolutely nothing. Part panel show, part interview, the Beaverton Weekly Report is an hilarious look at whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s going on in the world around us. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll be just like watching CNN, only funnier and with fewer erectile dysfunction ads. Beaverton editor-in-chief welcomes Buzzfeed staff writer Kat Angus and comedian/television writer Ian MacIntyre to discuss the burning tire fire that is America. They get into the Republicans desire to kill poor people (3:00), the sexual assault as pre-existing condition portion of the AHCA (9:00), the media bubble Conservatives live in (12:00), and why seeing Barack Obama again is like running into an ex who got in great shape (15:00). Plus the Approximately 10 Minute Long Quiz is able to find some fake news about Donald Trump that is worse than what he is actually doing.
