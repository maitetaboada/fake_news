President Donald Trump supporters are celebrating after the Supreme Court issued its decision to reinstate the ‚ÄoeMuslim migrant‚Äù travel ban, for now. Liberal nutjobs across the country are freaking out and hoping that one thing mentioned by the left-leaning Supreme Court Justices will reverse Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s executive order in the future. The mainstream media is slanting this Trump win in a bad light, but we have the truth they refuse to tell you. President Trump has been vindicated by the Supreme Court with their decision to reinstate the travel ban to six majority-Muslim nations. The court decided to allow the travel ban to proceed with hearings on the matter this fall. Three conservative Justices, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas wrote the dissent, stating they would have allowed the travel ban to proceed, with no need to have hearings later. ‚ÄoeJustice Clarence Thomas dissented with Justice Samuel Alito and newly-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch, saying the court didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go far enough. Thomas said he would have stayed the injunctions ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>in full,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> adding the government is ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>likely to succeed on the merits,'‚Äù reports CNN. Thomas expressed concern with the ‚Äoecourt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s remedy‚Äù and said he fears it will ‚Äoeprove unworkable.‚Äù Those conservative Justices got it right. In essence, they are saying that Trump has every right to enact the travel ban as president and they added that Trump will win this fall when they hear the case because of the ‚Äoemerits‚Äù ‚Ä" the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right under the Constitution is iron clad. This also is the SCOTUS (Supreme Court of the United States) telling the Ninth Circuit court that they were full of crap. There is one caveat to the travel ban, as the Court wrote, ‚ÄoeAn American individual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded.‚Äù So, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s it. If a person can prove they are related to an American and have a legitimate ‚Äoehardship,‚Äù then they will be vetted and allowed to come to the U.S. As you can imagine, the liberal media and those leftist loons in the country who hate Trump are freaking out, as if SCOTUS has ordered Nazi concentration camps erected in America. In fact, many of them are so crazy and in denial that they think the travel ban is not in effect. These folks need help and are not in reality. Trump loses again on his "Muslim Travel Ban" SCOTUS upholds the stay until the full case is heard‚Ä¶!! ‚Ä" Citizens Fed Up () June 26, 2017 SCOTUS will keep stay in place until it hears the case in October. Sorry, Donnie. No Muslim Travel Ban for you!#SoMuchWinning #Loser ‚Ä" Ron Asher () June 26, 2017 That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what happens when you tune into MSNBC or CNN. These people were listening to the liberal pundits who are actually saying Trump ‚Äoedidn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t win.‚Äù The trending headline is ‚ÄoeSCOTUS will hear Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s travel ban case in October,‚Äù but that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not completely accurate. The real news is that the SCOTUS reinstated Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s travel ban until they will hear the case in October, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s highly unlikely that Trump won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t win again in October since the SCOTUS already overturned the Ninth Circuit with this ruling. Sure, the liberal Justices could place that one caveat as a permanent clause, but so what? That isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t enough to stop Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s goal of stopping the flow of Muslim migrants that caused the disaster we see in Europe. Those who supported Trump during the election did so with this very ban in mind, and now, we see it happening. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in contrast to the sinking Democratic Party whose only message is to resist everything the president does. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got nothing as Trump wins again.
