As President Donald Trump landed to give the commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy, reporters were like sharks surrounding their prey. This only resulted in the president doing something at the event that is causing patriots to wildly cheer as the media gets schooled once again by the man who is really in charge. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to miss one of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s greatest moments, putting the liberal loons in their place. President Donald Trump defied media coverage of his presidency, vowing at the Coast Guard Academy graduation to keep fighting for the people who elected him president. Graduates in the audience cheered the president, proving it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only the liberal loons who are ratcheting up so much hate against him. ‚ÄoeLook at the way I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been treated lately especially by the media,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄoeNo politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly.‚Äù The president made his remarks during his commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut, offering his advice to the graduates. ‚ÄoeYou will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve and that are not always warranted, but you have to put your head down and fight, fight, fight,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄoeNever ever, ever give up. Things will work out just fine.‚Äù Breitbart reports, ‚ÄoeTrump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s remarks are the first public remarks since leaked Comey memos accused Trump of trying to shut down an investigation into his investigation into his former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. The president encouraged cadets to fight hard for what they believed in.‚Äù ‚ÄoeYou can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t let them get you down,‚Äù Trump added. ‚ÄoeYou can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t let the critics and the naysayers get in the way of your dreams. The more righteous your fight, the more opposition you will face. I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get elected to serve the Washington media or special interests. I got elected to serve the forgotten men and women of our country, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m doing.‚Äù That caused a flurry of activity from patriots on social media, cheering and loving that the man they elected is fighting for our cause. Once again, just like during the campaign, the media is so out of touch with how the American people really feel. Crowd erupts after that very moment. ‚Ä" Cry Partisan () May 17, 2017 I LOVE MY PRESIDENT!!!! May God always bless, protect and give our President Trump wisdom and strength!!! #MAGA !!! ‚Ä" GloriDays () May 17, 2017 Our Is Right He has been Treated TERRIBLE Democrats keep Trying so hard 2 TAKE HIM OUT OF WH bc NOTES ON A PAPER BY Comey Get Real ‚Ä" Mstweetie For Trump () May 17, 2017 Remember the liberal press when Trump was running for president? There was no way Trump would win and everyone hated him, right? Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what the media outlet The Nation said back in June 2016: ‚ÄoeTrump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s success in the spring says nothing about how he will do in the fall. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s likely that the rhetoric that won him those 13 million votes will turn off millions of other voters he needs if he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to win in November.‚Äù Poll after poll had Hillary Clinton ahead because the mainstream media cares nothing about facts and everything about their own agenda. Let them go after Trump. Americans patriots know how that will end. President Trump has been constantly harassed by bogus stories and traitors in his midst who are leaking false information. Those elites in the mainstream media and the Obama-Clinton globalists still lurking in positions of power in Washington, D.C., will soon be thrown out as President Donald Trump drains that swamp. Good riddance to those losers. We the People put Trump in charge, and there isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a damn thing they can do about it. Their time was over on November 8th, 2016.
