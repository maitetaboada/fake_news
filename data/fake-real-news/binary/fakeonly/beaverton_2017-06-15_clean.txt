By: Financial Columnist Mark Langshire We all know that Kathleen Wynneâ€<sup>TM</sup>s minimum wage hike is going to kill jobs. Some studies and rough projectionsâ€"and I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t think I need to bog down this piece by going into any detailâ€"show that upwards of 100,000 Ontarians could be out of work as a result. Now I may just be a financial columnist who has absolutely zero suggestions for how to help fix Ontarioâ€<sup>TM</sup>s veritable economic problems and shrinking middle class, but even I can see a disaster on the horizon. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m not saying that the government shouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t be presenting solutions or making suggestions, because otherwise people like me wouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t be able to make relentless criticisms while offering nothing to humanity. What Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m saying is that actually doing something, doing anything, to cause a change in this stifling economy would be a catastrophe. Unless they wanted to cut taxes, that would actually be really great. Do the Liberals think that passing on the cost of a $15 minimum wage to consumers is fair? Just look at what happened in Seattle. But donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t actually look it up, just take my condescension as all the evidence you need. Any idiot can see that Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m right, and youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re not an idiot. Right? I trust that if youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re still reading this, you either agreed with me in the first place or you were undecided and my aggressive tone and grand sweeping claims have beat you into submission. Also consider that if we raise our minimum wage here on Ontario, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll be higher than in other provinces. Thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s obviously bad, for reasons. I really canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t stress enough how awful this would be for the province, and the Liberals know it too. Weâ€<sup>TM</sup>re talking about 100,000 people losing their jobs. Actually, letâ€<sup>TM</sup>s bump that up to 500,000. Why not save those jobs, and cut taxes while theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re at it? Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m not just giving the same strawman arguments Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve made in the past to protect the status quo and fill my weekly column, Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m giving slightly altered versions of those arguments to make a different strawman that stokes different fears. Change is good, but itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s also bad. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s very bad, nothing should change. Unless you cut my taxes, because thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s the good kind of change. Fight for your job, Ontario. Which is to say, fight for your three to four on average jobs, and fight for my one job. Tags: jobs, Liberals, Minimum Wage, Ontario, Taxes
