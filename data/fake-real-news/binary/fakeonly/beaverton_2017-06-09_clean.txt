LONDON ‚Ä" British Prime Minister Theresa May has secured a coalition government deal with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland after promising to re-occupy the Irish Republic. DUP Leader Arlene Foster announced that the invasion to un-liberate the Irish will begin sometime next week in an effort to recover the former colonial possession which was granted independence in 1922. ‚ÄoeWe will support Ms. May‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Conservative government so long as Ireland is returned to its rightful British rulers,‚Äù announced Foster. ‚ÄoeWe will also support the government‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exit from the European Union so long as Catholics are thoroughly disenfranchised in the process.‚Äù Sources at 10 Downing Street explained that May made the Irish re-occupation concession after the DUP said that they would stop using terms such as ‚ÄoeDirty Dogans‚Äù and ‚Äoeclimate change is an international conspiracy‚Äù in their party platform.
