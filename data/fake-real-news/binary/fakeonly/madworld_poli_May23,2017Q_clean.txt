A new video has surfaced of gorgeous Ivanka Trump sitting with the royal entourage during her recent visit to Saudi Arabia. As she sat next to King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the video cameras were rolling, and luckily for us, someone caught the Saudi royal doing something that can only be explained by what people are now calling the ‚ÄoeIvanka effect.‚Äù According to Daily Star, Ivanka arrived in Saudia Arabia with her husband Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump, and the rest of the entourage from America to the sound of trumpets blaring, cannons booming, and fighter jets streaking overhead, leaving red, white, and blue contrails in the sky. The purpose of the visit was for Trump to rebuild the relationship with Saudi Arabia, but as you can see in the video, the Saudi King may have had other things on his mind as he sat next to Ivanka. As the camera gets rolling, Ivanka can be seen laughing and smiling as the Saudi royals sit on each side of her. It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take long for King Salman, to her right, to become a little more distracted than he may have wanted people to notice. Most of us probably don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to know what was going through his head at that very moment, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s safe to assume it didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have much to do with politics, international relationship building, or world peace. The ‚ÄoeIvanka effect‚Äù hit him like a freight train as he stares at her like a deer in the headlights. Immediately after the visit on Saturday, May 20th, 2017, Ivanka‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s name started a viral uptrend with fans on social media using the phrase ‚Äoebint Trump,‚Äù which means daughter of Trump in Arabic. The King seems to be blissfully lost in a daydream as he sits next to the 35-year-old blonde bombshell after both Ivanka and Melania Trump decided not to wear burkas, according to The Mercury News. So, she probably was quite the sight for sore eyes for a man who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s used to only looking at what amounts to a bedsheet covering any woman in his presence. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hilarious watching the King, who has been married three times and fathered at least 13 children, stare at Ivanka as if she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s available. Sure, the guy has more money than he knows what to do with, but unfortunately for him, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think female genital mutilation and the public execution of women are quite Ivanka‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s style.
