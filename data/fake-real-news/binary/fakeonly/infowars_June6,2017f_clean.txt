More on this as it comes in. Working on updates and and second post at the same timeâ€¦ How the fuck did this person have Top Secret security clearance? The whole accountreads like a Louise Mensch parody job. Also, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s fair to ask what the hell her parents were thinking when they named their daughter Reality. But thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a separate post altogether. EDIT: Apparently she changed her own name to Reality. This is a major sign of mental illness and should have tipped someone off to her dangerous narcissism before she was able to harm the country. 9 (Thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s the Iranian foreign minister sheâ€<sup>TM</sup>s tweeting at.) Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m mixing screens in with tweet embeds so I can beat the rush thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s sure to ensue. Theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve all been confirmed, however. This chick was a full blown communist, hated Trump, and despised her own raceâ€¦and those are just the highlights. Again, I ask: how did this person have Top Secret security clearance? BACKGROUND: More rantingsâ€¦
