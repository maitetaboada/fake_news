Kathy Griffin is not content with fading away into obscurity after having ruined her own career by posing with what appeared to President Donald Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bloody, severed head. At a press conference on Friday, the D-list comedian, accompanied by her lawyer, vowed to fight back against the Trump family‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoebullying.‚Äù However, something was noticeably missing from her little publicity stunt, and it blows Griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s credibility right out of the water. ‚ÄoeHe broke me,‚Äù Griffin said on Friday. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve had everybody turn on me.‚Äù Indeed, whatever semblance of a career Griffin had before releasing her blasphemous photo is effectively over. She was fired from her annual New Year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Eve gig with CNN and has been losing endorsement deals right and left ever since. She also shared a bizarre new excuse for having released the image in the first place, one which was so half-baked that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hard to believe it took her so many days to come up with it. Griffin and her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, defended her video several times as ‚Äoeedgy‚Äù and ‚Äoein your face‚Äù comedy, and said it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not fair that Trump bullied her. Bloom said the video was meant to mock Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign comment when he said there was ‚Äoeblood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever‚Äù in response to Megyn Kelly, who was then at Fox News. [Source: Washington Examiner] ‚ÄoeIt was a parody of Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own sexist remarks, taken to an extreme, absurdist visual,‚Äù said Bloom. ‚ÄoeThe message is clear: criticize the president, lose your job. And that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what happened to Kathy.‚Äù Of course, any sane person recognizes that what Griffin did went far beyond ‚Äoecriticizing the president.‚Äù And, it clearly was no reference to comments Trump made about Megyn Kelly. In a world plagued by horrific acts of terror, Griffin made light of extremism while threatening the president‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s life by posing with what appeared to be his beheaded likeness. There is simply no other way to slice it. Still, she believes that she is the one who has been wronged. ‚ÄoeWhat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s happening to me has never happened, ever, in the history of this great country,‚Äù said Griffin, ‚Äoewhich is that a sitting president of the United States, his grown children, and the first lady are personally, I feel, personally trying to ruin my life forever. Forever.‚Äù In the midst of taking questions from the press, Griffin tried her darnedest to break down and cry in order to give a convincing performance. However, if you look closely, you can clearly see that there are no tears falling from her eyes, even as she attempts to make her voice crack as if she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s speaking through tears.

She ought to just go away for awhile until the world moves on from her shameful stunt and begins to forget what a pitiful loser she is because she isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fooling anyone with sob stories and waterworks, or the lack thereof.
