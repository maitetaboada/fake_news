After D-list comedian Kathy Griffin released a gruesome image on Tuesday, in which she is seen holding the severed head of what appears to be President Donald Trump, the liberal mainstream media collectively drug their feet when it came to condemning her sick move. One of the major culprits was CNN, which employs Griffin as a host of the network‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s annual New Year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Eve programming. After taking their sweet time to fire Griffin, CNN has now paid a massive price for their initial impartiality on the matter. Griffin has co-hosted a live New Year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Eve broadcast on CNN since 2007 alongside network anchor Anderson Cooper, who denounced her photo on Twitter, saying, ‚ÄoeFor the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.‚Äù For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate. ‚Ä" Anderson Cooper () May 31, 2017 CNN also released a statement on Tuesday, which said, ‚ÄoeWe found what she did disgusting and offensive. We are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down. We are evaluating our New Year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Eve coverage and have made no decisions at this point.‚Äù That might have been the end of it had the public outcry not been so severe. However, supporters of the president were vocal in their disgust over Griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s photograph, noting that had a celebrity done the same to former President Barack Obama, the media and the left would have had a field day. On Wednesday, CNN finally decided to fire Griffin. But, the network did not do so before losing one of their main advertisers first. The ADT Corporation, the largest security company in the United States and Canada, announced Wednesday that it will pull its ads from CNN in the wake of the growing drama surrounding a photograph showing Kathy Griffin lifting up a bloodied decapitated head meant to resemble President Donald Trump. A Twitter user sent ADT a message asking the Florida-based company to ‚Äoedrop CNN.‚Äù ‚ÄoeWe do not support these views,‚Äù ADT responded. ‚ÄoeWe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve begun the process of pulling our ads from this network.‚Äù [Source: Breitbart] We do not support these views. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve begun the process of pulling our ads from this network. ‚Ä" ADT () May 31, 2017 Sadly, Griffin and CNN are not the only ones who have not walked away from this scandal unscathed; Barron Trump has had to suffer the consequences of the washed-up celebrity‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shameful stunt. The 11-year-old son of the president was watching television with his mother on Tuesday when the news came on and he saw the image of Griffin holding what appeared to be his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s head. At just 11-years-old and not knowing who Kathy Griffin is, Barron thought that something awful had befallen his father. ‚ÄoeMommy, mommy!‚Äù he reportedly screamed, looking for First Lady Melania Trump to come and see what was on their television screen. Kathy Griffin deserves every bit of the backlash she receives from this photograph. She ought to be blackballed from ever working again in show business, though it is unlikely that will happen. That level of severity is traditionally reserved for conservatives who speak out against liberal politicians.
