I saw you giving me the eye from across the subway car! Yeah, Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m talking to you Mr. plaid shirt and blue jeans! Something about me amuses you or something? Take this simple quiz to find out if you think youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re better than me, big man! 1. So youâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve got fancy, black, high-top sneakers and all Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve got are these sandwich bags wrapped around my feet. What? You think youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re better than me? These high-tops are objectively better at protecting my feet from the elements, the harsh ground surface, and the general filth that covers our public areas. They are also more eye pleasing than your Glad-brand food packaging. Are those 2003 Glad-brand zip-seal food fresheners?! Oh man, that was a limited edition run. You almost never see anyone using/wearing those anymore. I will trade you my high-tops for them! Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m sorry, who are you? Did I do something to upset you? 2. Well la-dee-da! You have nice looking aviator sunglasses and I just connect my index finger and thumb into circles and put them over my eyes. You too good for me or something?! These are $700 polarized, glass-lensed, whale bone Maui Jims. What you are doing is just bizarre. By any measure my eye protection is superior. Holy cow! I have fingers too and here I am wearing expensive sunglasses like a chump. You, sir, are a genius! Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m actually getting a little uncomfortable. You just approached me from the other end of the subway and started accusing me of thingsâ€¦ 3. Yeah, thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s right, I have wallet chains leading from all four of my pants pockets, each connecting to a different belt loop. You donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have any. Suddenly youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re the King of England or whatever? I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t think pickpockets are really a thing around here anymore and itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s really inefficient to carry around four different wallets if that is indeed what youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re doing. Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re also very loud when you walk. I think my strategy is a little better, yes. But how will this cityâ€<sup>TM</sup>s many pickpockets know which pocket to pick? Ooooooooh, thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s the point! Nicely done. Please, your chains look fine. I just want to get back to reading my copy of Heart of Darkness in peace. 4. Wow! So you noticed that Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m actively bleeding from my lip and ears. Does that make me worse than you?! Most people would agree that not bleeding from your face is better than bleeding from your face. How do you make your ears do that?! Teach me! Oh god. Do you need medical help. Someone push the emergency button! 5. So my nameâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Theodore Q. Butthole! Think yours is any better? My name is Stan Swift. Yes I do. Is that Dutch? I love the Dutch! I have mace in my pocket Check Results Quiz: You think youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re better than me?! You DO think youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re better than me! Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve got life all figured out.
