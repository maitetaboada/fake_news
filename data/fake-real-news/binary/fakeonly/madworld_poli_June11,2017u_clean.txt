During Thursday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, perhaps the biggest bombshell of former FBI Director James Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s entire testimony came to light, and it had nothing to do with the Russians colluding with President Donald Trump to help him win the White House. On the contrary, we found out that Comey had enlisted the help of a close friend in order to leak a memo of a conversation he had with President Trump to the New York Times. Now, something quite concerning has happened to the man. Following Thursday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hearing, Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman confirmed to reporters that he was the friend Comey had used to leak the conversation with Trump to the NYT. However, just moments after making that confirmation, Daniel Richman disappeared. Richman, a former federal prosecutor who worked with Comey at Columbia in 2013, left his home on Henry Street in Brooklyn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Richmond Heights shortly after the hearing. Neighbors and family refused to answer questions and a doorman at the building turned reporters away. Comey may have inadvertently opened a can of worms on himself by telling the Senate Intel Committee that he ‚Äoeasked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter‚Äù in the hopes it ‚Äoemight prompt the appointment of a special counsel.‚Äù [Source: BizPac Review] Shortly after Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s testimony, the Columbia University website crashed as it was flooded with people trying to find out more about the man whose biography at the Ivy League school states he is ‚Äoecurrently an adviser to FBI Director James B. Comey.‚Äù The biography also states that Richman was a consultant to the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury on federal criminal matters. As news emerged that Comey leaked details of his conversations with President Trump to his friend and confidant Daniel Richman, old clips of Richman speaking to the press have popped up on social media, with some pointing out that he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exactly look like a very sane man. James Comey leaked details of his conversation with to 'friend and confidant' Daniel Richman. Does this man look sane to you? ‚Ä" Josh Caplan () June 8, 2017 Richman‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sudden disappearance has led to a slew of questions. Did Comey inform him ahead of time that he would be testifying to the fact that the pair were responsible for leaking the Trump memo? Was Richman prepared to go into hiding to avoid having to answer for his actions? Even more sinister, could he be the new Seth Rich? All of these questions still remain unanswered, but here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what he do know: President Trump did NOT collude with Russia, and James Comey is a traitor of the worst kind. If you recall, he prosecuted General David Petraeus for the same crime he admitted to on Thursday. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a damn good thing Trump fired his butt when he did.
