VANCOUVER ‚Ä" British Columbia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s corporate and union interests have announced that they will replace all party leaders with better, more eloquent lobbyists for Wednesday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s televised debate. ‚ÄoeAfter discussing it with the other CEOs, we decided it was time to let Christy go,‚Äù explained Teck CEO Donald R. Lindsay, whose company has donated more than $2 million to the BC Liberal Party. ‚ÄoeWe weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t getting our money‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s worth as she seems to be struggling in the polls.‚Äù Representing the Liberals will be seasoned lobbyist Mia Thompson, who will try to persuade voters with a flashy video outlining strong corporate values for the province. ‚ÄoeWe really think [Thompson] puts the special in special interest,‚Äù said a representative from the New Car Dealers Association of BC. ‚ÄoeShe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s planning to sit down with every voter for a nice steak dinner so they know the status quo is a safe bet.‚Äù Filling in for NDP Leader John Horgan is Harry Chong, a former union lawyer and registered lobbyist bankrolled by the BC Government and Service Employees‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Union, the United Steelworkers, and CUPE BC. ‚ÄoeYou know, I wish we didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to do this,‚Äù lamented BCGEU President Stephanie Smith, ‚Äoebut everyone else is doing it, so who are we to make our own decisions?‚Äù Chong is expected to make a strong case for better collective bargaining agreements and improving employee health benefits to include coverage for ‚Äoestriker‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pancreas.‚Äù Finally, the Greens have replaced their leader with someone with even less name recognition.
