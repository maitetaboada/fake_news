Democrats have made their stance on our federal laws abundantly clear as they continue to advocate for illegal aliens who break our laws, saying that they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re ‚Äoeentitled‚Äù to American freedoms. Unfortunately for the morons dumb enough to keep running their mouths, President Donald Trump just slapped them big time ‚Ä" and all it took was a ‚Äoeyuge‚Äù 5-year bombshell to do it. Democrats clearly don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t interpret the Constitution as it was intended as they are always seeking to change its meaning. The left not only allows but even encourages people to virtually walk all over the cherished document in their pursuit of so-called ‚Äoeprogressivism.‚Äù However, that practice most recently came to a screeching halt when President Donald Trump was elected. Although the left is still trying to pervert the words of our Founding Fathers, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re no longer able to allow entitled brats to do as they please without repercussion as they did for the past 8 years. Take, for instance, the left‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s stance on illegal immigration. Rather than looking at those people as criminals who broke our nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s laws to invade our country illegally, they want you to think they are hopeless people just looking for a better life or, at least, a break. As we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve come to find out, though, that isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the case as loosened border security allowed for a massive influx of cartel members and drugs to cross the border, along with an increase in human trafficking. Of course, there were also those people who were too lazy to go through the proper channels coming in as well, hoping to take advantage of our generous benefits. Unfortunately for them but luckily for us, now that Trump is in office, those same people are facing the repercussions of their actions as the law is once again being enforced. People in our country illegally are being deported in unprecedented numbers, but it looks like that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not all. As it turns out, Trump has most recently dropped a 5-year bombshell on Democrats after they wanted to encourage people to violate our nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rules. According to Mail Online, ‚ÄoePresident Donald Trump has said he will pursue legislation that would bar immigrants from being eligible for welfare for at least five years.‚Äù Yes, you read that right. Although the left wants you to believe that these criminals are ‚Äoeentitled‚Äù to the freedoms we enjoy, that isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the case. In fact, Trump went on to say that ‚Äoethe time has come‚Äù for ‚Äoenew immigration rules‚Äù that would require those seeking admission into the country to support themselves financially and to be paying into the system for at least five years before taking advantage of our welfare. If Democrats are right and these people are just coming here for a better life, then this shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be an issue. I mean, what kind of life is living off the system when you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re perfectly capable of working? This land is the melting pot of the world, and immigration is absolutely necessary. However, it has to be controlled or else you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll impact the lives of citizens, currently here, in a negative way. Follow the rules and reap the rewards. if you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t, you can go be a freeloader in the country that you came from. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really as simple as that because we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re done paying people to be lazy.
