President Donald Trump had a plethora of memorable moments at the NATO summit in Belgium this week, but one particular photograph went viral, and it isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hard to see why. The snapshot of Trump with the President of Croatia was being virally shared within minutes of getting posted online. As an unsuspecting Trump stood next to Croatia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s female president, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, it was awkwardly apparent how mesmerized she was by her American counterpart, leading to quite a few hilarious memes. Find someone that looks at you the way the President of Croatia looks at Donald Trump. ‚Ä" Alana Mastrangelo () May 26, 2017 According to Young Conservatives, Grabar-Kitarovic is a proud Trump fan. She even purchased tickets to his inauguration in January, but she ultimately decided not to attend. Elected in 2015, Grabar-Kitaroviƒá is a former foreign minister and a member of Croatia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s centre-right HDZ party. On the issues, the Croatian president seems to be much more aligned with President Trump than Merkel or Macron, who would likely love nothing better than to see the entire population of the Arab world settled in the middle of their nations. [Source: BizPac Review] Much like Trump, Grabar-Kitaroviƒá has been verbal about preventing droves of refugees from making their way into her country. ‚ÄoeIt may not be politically correct, but we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re making a terrible mistake if we think that people who learned in school and listened to the religious authorities throughout their lifetime in Afghanistan saying that women are inferior to men will now, overnight, take our values,‚Äù she said. She knows a real man when she sees one ‚Ä" Noreen () May 26, 2017 looks like someone has a little crush ‚Ä" Doc Holliday () May 26, 2017 she's smokin' hot ‚Ä" (((One4Zion))) () May 26, 2017 ‚Ä" Dave Mitchell () May 26, 2017 Macron is a Merkel lapdog. ‚Ä" “oe≈--√Ø≈°◊"÷º”©‚*'·ªØ–Ø () May 26, 2017 The Croatian president has also expressed the potential need for a fence to ‚Äoeprotect‚Äù her nation from migrants flooding in. Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic said her country may have to build a fence to keep migrants from flooding in, a tactic already tried by Hungary, according to an article Wednesday in the Jutarnji List newspaper. ‚ÄoeI would like to avoid that, but I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see how else we can protect ourselves,‚Äù said Grabar-Kitarovic, a conservative whose role is largely ceremonial. Croatia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s liberal government has previously said it will not build a fence. [Source: USA Today] President Donald Trump may have been snubbed by France‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s President Emmanuel Macron and Germany‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Chancellor Angela Merkel during his overseas trip, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s clear he has a friend in President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic. Perhaps if she had her way, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be a bit more than friends, but I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think our fabulous First Lady has anything to worry about. Melania made a stunning impression this week as well, showing other wives of foreign leaders from around the world how it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s done. Overall, Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s first international trip as president was a resounding success. We totally understand how Grabar-Kitarovic feels ‚Ä" it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s got to be hard to hide your emotions when you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re standing next to such an alpha male.
