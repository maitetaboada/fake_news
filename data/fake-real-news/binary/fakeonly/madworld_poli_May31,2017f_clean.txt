Kathy Griffin is backpedaling after her attempt at ‚Äoecomedy‚Äù bombed like it always does. Unfortunately for her, it seems that things just got worse after a few keen eyes picked up on the secret message she initially included. Although Kathy attempted to drum up some attention, even she wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t prepared for the storm that just came rolling in. After being investigated by Secret Service and her sponsors dropping left and right, she offered a public apology, but it was too little too late. Now, it seems that her disgusting video did a little more than just take a shot at Trump. As we all know, Kathy was seen with what appeared to be the decapitated head of President Trump ‚Ä" but that apparently wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t all. Mad World News previously reported that Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 11-year-old son, Barron, was left scarred, thinking that she was actually holding his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s head. Sadly, that wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the only parental figure Kathy took aim at as she also went after the boy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother. According to Clash Daily, Kathy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoevideo and the photographs were also a sly slam at the First Lady, Melania.‚Äù As you may remember, Melania made headlines during her husband‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presidential campaign by wearing a shirt with a ‚Äoepussy bow‚Äù just after the Hollywood Access tapes leaked. Clearly seen in Kathy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disturbing image, she too was wearing a shirt with a ‚Äoepussy bow‚Äù in a clear swipe at the First Lady. Of course, now that the public is being clued in on the secondary attack, it has launched an entirely new backlash in the so-called ‚Äoecomedian‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s‚Äù direction. When it comes down to it, this was beyond too far as it stands. It is completely and entirely unacceptable to pretend to cut off the head of the President of the United States of America. Not only that, but it incites others to behave violently, which is exactly why Secret Service is involved. I was a Secret Service agent for over a decade and this pseudo-celebrity has no idea the damage that this type of sick content does. Sad. ‚Ä" Dan Bongino () May 30, 2017 It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s one thing not to like Trump, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s another thing entirely to wish he was dead. However, unnecessarily bringing in his innocent family for a few shots has only further elevated this to an inappropriate level of epic proportions. With that being said, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no wonder why Barron is terrified and having an extremely hard time with this all. Imagine being just 11-years-old and seeing a woman posing with your father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bloody, decapitated head plastered on television. Now, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re finding out that Kathy actually attacked his mother as well. Where will it end with the left? The hate spewed by liberals is getting out of hand, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time that deranged morons like this are held accountable for their actions. My guess is, a few days in a cage would teach not only this entitled brat a thing or two about the law but keep others from violating it as well. If they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not going to act like civilized members of society voluntarily, maybe it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to give them a punishment for their actions.
