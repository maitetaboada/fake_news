President Donald Trump just made a decision about Islam that has Muslims furious, and there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nothing any activist federal court judge can do about it. After years of previous presidents pandering to Muslims at the White House, American patriots all over the country are celebrating Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s epic move. Wait until you see what he did during their most holy holiday. According to The Gateway Pundit, Trump sent a clear message to Muslims by decisively ending the White House tradition of hosting the Iftar dinner to celebrate the Islamic holiday, Ramadan. The ludicrous practice was started by impeached former Democrat president and cigar aficionado Bill Clinton. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Hussein Obama continued to honor Ramadan with an official White House dinner during their administrations, much to the dismay of millions of Americans who treasure our Christian heritage. It just doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make sense to celebrate a religion that teaches death to Christians. Ramadan began on May 27, 2017, this year and ended at sundown on Saturday, June 24, 2017. Muslims around the world celebrate the end of their holy month by celebrating the holiday Eid al-Fitr, the ‚Äoefeast of breaking of the fast.‚Äù Ending the traditions of Islam in America is long overdue. Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s administration did not even respond to multiple requests from the outraged mainstream media for comment regarding the absent Iftar dinner, according to The Washington Post. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did, however, say the State Department would not be honoring the Muslim holiday as previous administrations have in the past by hosting a Ramadan reception. In addition, Tillerson sent out a brief statement saying, ‚ÄoeBest wishes to all Muslims celebrating Eid al-Fitr.‚Äù ‚ÄoeThis holiday marks the culmination of Ramadan, a month in which many experience meaning and inspiration in acts of fasting, prayer, and charity,‚Äù Tillerson said in the statement. ‚ÄoeThis day offers an opportunity to reflect on our shared commitment to building peaceful and prosperous communities. Eid Mubarak, ‚Äù he added. Despite Tillerson‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attempt to smooth things over with his well-wishes for Muslims, the White House stayed the course and did not even acknowledge the Islamic holiday. These are fundamental common sense decisions that Americans should expect from any president. This year, Ramadan has been an opportunity for many Muslims to celebrate the recent terrorist attacks in England, where an Islamic jihadist killed men, women, and children in cold blood. According to a report by Newsweek, many Muslims in the United States are furious with Trump‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s decision to snub the ‚Äoereligion of peace‚Äù and go golfing instead of honoring their holy day. ‚ÄoeIt is disappointing because that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been a good tradition,‚Äù Imam Talib Shareef of the Nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Mosque in Washington, D.C., said in an interview with Newsweek Friday. ‚ÄoeTo stop it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t send a good message. You get the chance to go golfing and all this other kind of stuff. How come you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have time for a population of your society that needs some assistance? The message that it sends is that we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not that important.‚Äù The idea that Muslims are the population within our society that needs assistance is tremendously stupid. According to a 2016 report by Investment Watch, 91.4 % of Muslim ‚Äoerefugees‚Äù in America are on food stamps while 68.3 % receive cash welfare. But, the imam‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s declaration of need is exactly how Muslims carry out their subversion of Western countries. The majority of them immigrate with no intention of working or assimilation and then live like parasites while growing their own population at the expense of the host body they are trying to kill. Thank God, we finally have a president who isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t afraid to put an end to the idiotic political correctness of the past.
