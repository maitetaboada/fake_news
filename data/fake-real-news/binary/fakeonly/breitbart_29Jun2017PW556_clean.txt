The Star of David was used as a target for a mid-range ‚ÄoeQiam‚Äù ballistic missile test in December last year, a statement from the Permanent Mission of Israel to the United Nations said. ‚ÄoeThis use of the Star of David as target practice is hateful and unacceptable,‚Äù Israel‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said to the Council. A grainy image shows the Jewish symbol and next to it an impact crater can be seen. ‚ÄoeThe missile launch is not only a direct violation of UNSCR 2231, but is also a clear evidence of Iran‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s continued intention to harm the State of Israel,‚Äù Danon said, adding that ‚Äoethe targeting of a sacred symbol of Judaism is abhorrent.‚Äù ‚ÄoeThe Security Council must act immediately against this demonstration of hate and Iran‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s provocative violations that threaten the stability of the entire region,‚Äù added Danon. ‚ÄoeIt is the Iranians who prop up the Assad regime as hundreds of thousands are killed, finance the terrorists of Hezbollah as they threaten the citizens of Israel, and support extremists and tyrants throughout the Middle East and around the world,‚Äù he added.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the attack, ‚ÄoeI have one message for Iran: Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t threaten Israel.‚Äù In March of last year, Iran tested two ballistic missiles bearing the Farsi inscription, ‚ÄoeIsrael must be wiped out.‚Äù
