Anthony Weiner, the former Democratic Congressman from New York and husband of Huma Abedin, stood in front of a Federal judge on Friday as he broke down crying, muttering 4 words in a pathetic attempt to panhandle for mercy. After the sickening things Weiner was caught sexting with a 15-year-old girl, his 4-word defense has liberals cringing and conservatives laughing, and for good reason. Oddly enough, just a week after President Donald Trump fired corrupt FBI Director James Comey, the FBI arrested Weiner and escorted him to a Federal New York Courthouse on Friday, May 19th, according to the New York Post. Perhaps Comey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s absence and Weiner‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s day of judgment are a little more than coincidence. As Weiner stood before the judge on Friday, he reportedly broke down crying and said, ‚ÄoeI have a sickness‚Ä¶‚Äù Weiner may deserve an academy award for the performance he put on in front of the New York Federal Judge as he entered his guilty plea. ‚ÄoeI have a sickness, but I do not have an excuse,‚Äù the crying sexual predator told the court, according to a tweet sent out by New York Post reporter Kaja Whitehouse. Predictably, Weiner further reveals what a tremendous psychopath he is with the claim that his proclivity for underage girls is a ‚Äoesickness.‚Äù Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not confuse being sick-in-the-head with having an actual sickness such as heart disease or cancer. The fact that this man lacks any moral compass does not make him a victim of an involuntary medical condition. The FBI started investigating Weiner after claims were made that he sent a 15-year-old North Carolina girl sexually explicit text messages starting in 2016. Weiner pleaded guilty to one count of transferring obscene material to a minor which could have landed him in prison for up to 10 years. However, as part of his plea deal, the prosecution agreed to ask the court for a sentence of not more than 27 months. According to Washington Free Beacon, Weiner will be a registered sex-offender for the rest of his life, meaning that there won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be any future photo ops with his once again recently estranged wife and their children in front of an elementary school. After Abedin reportedly took Weiner back in March 2017, reports from just today state she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s finally filed for divorce. Apparently, Weiner‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s arrest was the deal breaker for Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s closest aide, not the fact he was trying to sleep with children. It is truly a shame that Weiner was not taken into custody and held for court, prior to Friday, May 19th, 2017. Considering that Comey was still in charge of the FBI until recently, it really isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t much of a surprise. Any other average American would have been detained for the things Weiner sexted to the 15-year-old girl, but when you have ties to Hillary Clinton, your crimes don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem to matter, not when Comey was in charge anyway. During an interview with the Daily Mail, the girl and her father said that Weiner knew she was a minor. Weiner, who used the alias ‚ÄoeT Dog,‚Äù texted and spoke to the girl over Skype. The former Democratic Congressman shared his ‚Äoerape fantasies‚Äù with the 15-year-old and asked her to dress up in school uniforms, according to her interview. ‚ÄoeHe had some rape fantasies. It would just be him showing up at my house when my dad was out of town,‚Äù the girl recalled. ‚ÄoeAnd just start undressing me, being forceful, asking me if I want to be dominated, strange questions.‚Äù Weiner reportedly once said to the girl, ‚ÄoeI would bust that tight p‚Ä"y so hard and so often that you would leak and limp for a week,‚Äù and sent her a few bare-chested selfies to show off his body. Weiner is a derivative of the liberal mantra ‚Äoeno absolutes‚Äù and extreme elitist arrogance. This perverse predator deserves far more than 27 months in prison. Weiner‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s guilty plea comes after a string of lewd and lascivious behavior spread out over the last several years, which eventually led to his separation from his wife Huma Abedin. Abedin has a mountain of her own troubles to deal with after some of Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s classified emails were found on Weiner‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s laptop, and hopefully, she will be next on the list to prosecute.
