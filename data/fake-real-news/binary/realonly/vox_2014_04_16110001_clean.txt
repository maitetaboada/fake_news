1. What is normcore? nNormcore is a fashion trend (though some, including Vice, insist it's more of a joke). The trend has many different looks, but it hinges on one premise: the wearer opts for clothes meant to be average. Wearers leave Chanel sneakers in the closet in favor of off-brand Keds; colorful shorts are traded for khaki cargo pants, and designer purses for backpacks. Normcore is the antithesis of the highly stylized, dark-denim, vintage-tee hipster look. nThe term normcore was coined on October 19, 2013 when the trend-casting group K-hole published "Youth mode: a Report on Freedom." For K-hole the goal of normcore was to blend into the crowd, to be unrecognizable from any other person, or as they wrote, "the new world order of blankness." To be normcore, according to K-hole, was "to understand that there is no such thing as normal." It is important to note that K-hole's initial definition of normcore has since been expanded and changed by popular culture. nThe fashion industry, however, is not built on blending into the crowd. As Erica Ceurlo for Vanity Fair points out, normcore is not about disappearing into a crowd, it's about standing out from a community of people dressed to the nines in designer wear. n2.

When did normcore become popular? n nImage courtesy of Gap. nThough the K-hole coining of the term normcore did not appear until October 2013, normcore as a fashion trend has existed for far longer. Normcore, at its most basic level, is fashionable people choosing to dress unfashionably, which is hardly a new idea. nA case could be made that normcore has existed since the popularization of ready-to-wear clothing in the early 1920s. Any clothing that is not made by hand or commissioned specifically for a person is ready-to-wear. Almost immediately after the creation of ready-to-wear fashion, it became a trend to wear what everyone else was wearing, especially if you were a wealthy person not used to sharing clothes with the commoners. nThis trope of rich people dressing below their income has appeared in popular culture for decades in dozens of movies including Ever After: A Cinderella Story and Disney's Aladdin. In the 1990s the rise of grunge fashion can be categorized as a normcore precursor, typified by people choosing to wear men's work boots and oversized cheap flannels. In 1990, high-fashion model Kate Moss was photographed wearing Birkenstocks, a very normcore shoe. nThough the word normcore surged in popularity since New York Magazine brought the word into the spotlight in February 2014, the trend has been alive for far longer. Citizens in cities like Portland and Austin have been sporting cargo shorts for years. As early as the summer of 2013, trendy people in New York were sporting nondescript pullovers and fanny packs. n4. What makes normcore a fashion trend? n nBarack Obama in normcore.

As Simon Doonan recounted for Slate, it's very easy to mistake your friend's boyfriend for a normcore believer, only to offend him. nInitially, normcore was a shift away from body-policing, where people expect others to conform to the fashion industry's definition of how people should appear, but as the movement has gained steam, magazines like Elle have gone right back to that practice, arguing that some people may not be able to "pull off" normcore. n8.
