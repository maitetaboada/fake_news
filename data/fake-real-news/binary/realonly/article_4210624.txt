The debate: Has the European experiment failed? - The Globe and Mail


On Friday night, four influential European thinkers will argue whether the European Union is doomed to failure or whether there is hope for renewal.

Niall Ferguson, a professor of history at Harvard University, will argue in favour of the resolution that 'the European experiment has failed.'

Peter Mandelson, a member of Britain's House of Lords, will argue against.

Mr. Ferguson will be joined by Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of Die Zeit, a German weekly. Lord Mandelson will be siding with Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a leader of the famous French student revolts in the sixties. These are their main arguments.

'For more than 10 years, it has been the case that Europe has conducted an experiment in the impossible.'

'European leaders are getting there and they need to not lose any further time because the world is very impatient.'
