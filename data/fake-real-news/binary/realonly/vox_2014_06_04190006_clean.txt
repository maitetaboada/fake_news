The Colbert Report is no longer with us, having aired its final episode last December. But though Stephen Colbert's show was primarily a comedy,Â a study out of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center found that, on one topic at least, his viewers actually learned quite a bit. nBack during election 2012, Colbert decided to give his viewers a crash course in our new, post-Citizens United campaign finance regime. In a series of hilarious segments, he formed a PAC, a Super PAC, a shadowy nonprofit group, and briefly announced his own candidacy. nColbert viewers were more likely to answer questions about campaign finance correctly nIn a later phone survey, after controlling for factors like general political knowledge and demographics, more frequent Colbert viewers were more likely to answer questions about campaign finance correctly. And the effect of Colbert viewership on these answers was stronger than viewership of CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, or the nightly news, according to the study by Bruce Hardy, Jeffrey Gottfried, Kenneth Winneg, and Kathleen Hall Jaimeson. nThese are the issues where Colbert's viewers overperformed in their demonstration of knowledge, paired with the Colbert segments they may have learned from: n1) Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions nColbert was very happy about this when real-life election lawyer Trevor Potter urged him to set one up: n nn nThe Colbert ReportGet More: Daily Show Full Episodes,Indecision Political Humor,The Colbert Report on Facebook n n n n nCOLBERT: "It therefore intends to raise individual, corporate, and labor funds in unlimited amounts!

So what do I have to tell the IRS about what happened with this money?"POTTER: "Nothing." n nThe takeaway nThe study's authors have a few ideas about why Colbert's lessons might have stuck.Â "Colbert's treatment of this complex issue did not simply explain the complexities of new campaign finance regulations," they write. "His insertion into the campaign process and real interaction with the legal system, FEC, and mock candidacy allowed him to instruct as he entertained." Humor could also play a role â€" the authors summarize research showing that "when political information is presented within the context of humor, viewers will be more attentive, motivated, and engaged," which "will foster learning."
