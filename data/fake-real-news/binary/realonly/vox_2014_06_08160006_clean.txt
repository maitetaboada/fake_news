June is LGBTQ Pride Month, which means Americans around the country should expect some colorful marches throughout the month. nJust a year after the US Supreme Court's ruling legalizingÂ same-sex marriage across the country, advocates now widely see Pride Month as a show of optimism and progress. But the month's events were originally inspired by acts of violence and discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer communities. nThe transformation speaks to much of the progress made on LGBTQ rights. But the fact that Pride Month is still deemed necessary also shows some of the progress left to be made on LGBTQ issues, especially on trans rights. nPride celebrations began to commemorate a pro-LGBTQ uprising nThe first march came at a time when Americans were considerably less accepting of gays and lesbians. Back in the 1970s, Gallup found Americans were evenly split on whether homosexuality should be legal in the first place. n n n(Gallup) n nThat first march, back when the events were known as Gay Pride Marches, took place in New York City in 1970 in commemoration of the Stonewall Riots. nThrough the 1960s, it was fairly common for police to raid gay- and transgender-friendly bars. But in June 1969, LGBTQ patrons at the Stonewall Inn in New York City decided they had enough and refused to cooperate with police. When police tried to arrest and allegedly mistreated the bar's customers and employees (includingÂ trans women of color), four nights of rioting commenced. Police and protestors were injured, and dozens were arrested. n"Police brutality (particularly NYPD raids of gay bars, nightclubs, and bathhouses) had been documented in New York City since the beginning of the century," Kevin Nadal, executive director at the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies, previously wrote in an email. "So, by 1969, LGBT people were quite fed up with this unfairness and decided to fight back." nA year after the riots, the Christopher Street Liberation Day Umbrella Committee held the first Pride March. n n nLGBTQ advocates show their support on the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots.

The idea, Sargeant explained, was to commemorate the Stonewall Riots and move away from a conservatism that had mired LGBTQ organizations, such as the Mattachine Societies, that led the movement at the time. n n"Before Stonewall, gay leaders had primarily promoted silent vigils and polite pickets, such as the 'Annual Reminder' in Philadelphia," Sargeant wrote. "Since 1965, a small, polite group of gays and lesbians had been picketing outside Liberty Hall. The walk would occur in silence. Required dress on men was jackets and ties; for women, only dresses. We were supposed to be unthreatening." nSargeant pointed to one particular situation that inspired him and his partner, Craig Rodwell, to do away with the careful approach: "When Craig returned from Philadelphia [from the 1969 Reminder], he was blistering over an incident: Washington Mattachine's Frank Kameny told two women holding hands that there would be 'none of that' and broke them apart. This physical act confirmed for Craig that we needed something much bigger and bolder than the Mattachine Society." nBreaking through that conservatism, however, proved to be difficult. The Christopher Street Liberation Day Umbrella Committee had to negotiate with a dozen small LGBTQ organizations to give everyone a seat at the table, and the committee had to leverage the mailing list Sargeant and Rodwell had built up after they opened one of the nation's first gay bookstores. nSargeant recalled the first march as much more of a protest than a celebration. There were thousands of people, but there were no floats, music, or scantily dressed men. Marchers instead carried signs, chanted, and waved to reportedly surprised onlookers. nNadal said the first march showed society that LGBTQ communities existed and included family members, friends, and neighbors. And it helped encourage other members of the LGBTQ communities to come out and be proud of who they are. nPride celebrations spread over time nThe knowledge and outrage of the Stonewall Riots gave LGBTQ advocates the momentum necessary to turn their cause into a true nationwide movement. n"Before Pride and Stonewall, there really wasn't a comprehensive LGBT movement," Nadal wrote. "Stonewall really was the first time that demonstrated that protesting and rioting and fighting back actually worked for the LGBT community." n"Before Pride and Stonewall, there really wasn't a comprehensive LGBT movement" nIndiana University sociologists Elizabeth Armstrong and Suzanna Crage explained that the reaction to the police raid at Stonewall Inn â€" the riots â€" resonated with LGBTQ people. After centuries of oppression, they understood why people would feel the need to react violently to yet another sign of discrimination and oppression. The Stonewall Riots, in other words, came at an exact moment in which social dissatisfaction and other political elements converged to push forward a larger LGBTQ movement. nIt took just a few years for the movement to spread across the country. On the same year of the first Pride March in New York City, marches also took place in Los Angeles and Chicago. The next year, Dallas, Boston, Milwaukee, and San Jose took part. By 1972, participating locations included Ann Arbor, Atlanta, Buffalo, Detroit, the District of Columbia, Miami, and Philadelphia. nAs Kameny later described, "By the time of Stonewall, we had 50 to 60 gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least 1500. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was 2500." nSince then, the LGBTQ movement has grown even further. At first, LGBTQ Pride was typically celebrated on the last Sunday of June as Gay Pride Day or Christopher Street Gay Liberation Day. Over time, that day grew to a month of events. nLGBTQ Pride Month is now more of a celebration than protest n n n nLGBTQ Pride Marches in the US have become much more celebratory in nature over the decades, with more attendees, participants, and organizations taking part each year in the events. nThere's good reason for the positive outlook: While Americans were divided on the legality of homosexuality in the 1970s, a majority now support same-sex marriages,Â and marriage equality is legal across the US following aÂ Supreme Court decision. n n n(Gallup) n nPride organizers, however, emphasize that there are still major problems facing LGBTQ communities. As a few examples, they point toÂ workplace discrimination, LGBTQ youth homelessness, the incarceration of LGBTQ people, the US military's ban on transgender soldiers, hate crimes, health issues likeÂ HIV/AIDS and Syphilis, and various other disparities. And most recently,Â trans people's use of the bathroom for their gender identity has become part of a huge nationwide political debate over LGBTQ rights. n"We don't have full equality throughout the nation," Jim Williams, march assistant at New York City Pride, previously told me. "Although we're very pleased with the progress that's been made, there's still a lot of work to be done." n n n(Mario Tama/Getty Images) n nPride Month highlights these issues by giving advocates a chance to rally supporters. The Pride Run, for instance, each year raises funds for a different LGBTQ organization. This year, contributions are going toÂ GLSEN, which focuses on LGBTQ issues in education. In the past, the run supported theÂ Anti-Violence Project,Â Broadway Cares / Equity Fights AIDS, the It Gets Better Project, the Ali Forney Center, andÂ Immigration Equality. nIn New York City, there are also huge historical overtones going back to the Stonewall Riots. New York City Pride, after all, arguably represents the birthplace of the world's modern LGBTQ rights movement. That's why march organizers closely follow the advice of the Stonewall 50 Committee, a group that is working toward commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, to stay true to Pride's original intent. nThe celebration of LGBTQ Pride has also spread to many more events than just a march. New York City's Pride group, for instance,Â plans to host a public rally, a festival, public dances, and even a family movie night. nParticipants "need an opportunity and a place to celebrate, to play, to feel comfortable, to dress how they want to dress, to march with their friends," Williams said. "There's something very empowering about walking down New York City streets with crowds of people cheering you on." nLGBTQ Pride Marches are also international, including in countries where the public remains much less supportive of LGBTQ people. In those places, the marches still act as one of the very few ways advocates can show their solidarity and support. nWhere can I attend my local LGBTQ Pride March? nFor a comprehensive list, GayPrideCalendar.com tracks all LGBTQ pride events. nIf you want to participate in one of the biggest LGBTQ pride events of the year, check the list for New York City, San Francisco, Montreal, London, Sydney, Berlin, Madrid, Amsterdam, Tel Aviv, Sao Paulo, and Buenos Aires.
