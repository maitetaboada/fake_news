It seems Minnesota will become the 22nd state to legalize medical marijuana. nThe decision comes after the state legislature and Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, reached a compromise on how medical marijuana will work in the state. n"This bill is citizen government at its best," Dayton said in a statement. "It has been led by parents, who deeply love their children, are anguished by their pain, and insist their government try to help them. As a father and grandfather, I both understand and admire their devotion." nThe bill will let qualified patients access the drug in pill, oil, or vapor form at eight distribution centers across the state, reports KSTP. It won't let patients smoke marijuana, which is generally considered less healthy. nUpdate: The Marijuana Policy Project wrote a summary of Minnesota's medical marijuana legislation here.
