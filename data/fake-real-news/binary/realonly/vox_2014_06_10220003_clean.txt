Diabetes is on the rise in America, according to a new report from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. nthe CDC projects the direct and indirect costs of diabetes total $245 billion nThe CDC estimates that 29.1 million people, or 9.3 percent of the US population, had diabetes in 2012. That's up from 25.8 million, or 8.3 percent of the US population, in 2010. nMore than one-fourth of the cases are undiagnosed, which means 8.1 million people most likely don't know they have diabetes. nThe rise comes with a large financial burden for the US. The CDC projects the direct and indirect costs of diabetes total $245 billion, with $176 billion going to direct medical costs and the rest going to indirect costs like disability, work loss, and premature death. nThe problem is poised to get a lot worse, too. The CDC estimates that 37 percent of US adults aged 20 and older, or about 86 million Americans, have prediabetes, when blood sugar levels are alarmingly high but not quite high enough to be classified as diabetes. This population is at a high risk for eventually developing diabetes, although lifestyle changes can prevent the disease. nWhat is diabetes, anyway?n nDiabetes is caused when the body can't properly process blood sugar. n n nAn insulin pen.

Type 1 is managed by directly injecting or pumping the body with insulin, the hormone that helps manage blood sugar. Type 2 is usually treated by adhering to a healthier diet and increasing exercise. nDiabetes is more prominent among men, minorities, and older populationsn nYounger people are much less likely to have diabetes. The CDC estimates, in fact, that more than one in four Americans 65 and older have the disease. n n n nMen also appear to be slightly more likely to develop diabetes. n n n nRacial and ethnic minorities also have much higher rates of the illness. n n n nSome experts blame added sugar for the risen nThe CDC's latest report offers no explanation for the rise. But, at least with type 2 diabetes, the rise of diabetes is linked to America's increasingly sedentary lifestyle. It's no coincidence that obesity is becoming a bigger problem as diabetes gets worse as well. nIt's no coincidence that obesity is becoming a bigger problem as diabetes gets worse as well nSome experts have also fixated on added sugar in particular to explain America's struggles with obesity and diabetes. n"The data says that the dose on average that is safe is six to nine teaspoons of added sugar per day. Currently, Americans are at 22 teaspoons of added sugar per day," said Robert Lustig of the University of California, San Francisco, in a previous interview. "That excess is driving obesity, diabetes, lipid problems, heart disease, cancer, dementia, fatty liver disease â€" virtually every chronic metabolic disease that you can think of is being driven by this excess of sugar." nOther experts dispute Lustig's focus on sugar. They argue the problems with the American diet are much more complicated. People should, according to Lustig's critics, focus on improving their diets and reducing excess across the board, instead of demonizing one ingredient or food. nWhatever the specific cause, everyone at least agrees on two changes that Americans could make to help prevent diabetes: eating healthier and exercising more often. nFurther reading n nThe case for treating sugar like a drug n40 maps that explain food in America nA 6-cent tax could be enough to get Americans to drink less soda nSoda is even worse for you than you thought n nUpdate: Added more context about how type 2 diabetes is developed. n n
