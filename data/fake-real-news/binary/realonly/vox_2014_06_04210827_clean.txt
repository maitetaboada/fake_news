The Supreme Court will not block same-sex marriages in Oregon, Justice Anthony Kennedy decided Wednesday. nThe decision means same-sex marriages will stand even as a potential challenge from the National Organization for Marriage works through the appeals process. NOM, which opposes same-sex marriages, is trying to intervene in the lawsuit challenging the state's same-sex marriage ban. nAfter a federal court's decision to allow same-sex marriages in Oregon, state officials announced they will not appeal. NOM has been trying to fill the void by intervening on behalf of its Oregon members. But so far a trial court refused to let NOM intervene, and higher courts have refused to put Oregon's same-sex marriages on hold as NOM's challenge works through the court system. nLGBT advocates largely expected Wednesday's order. They argue that NOM has no standing in the same-sex marriage cases. So if state officials decide not to appeal, same-sex marriages will remain in Oregon for the foreseeable future â€" unless a higher court, like the Supreme Court, steps in. nFurther reading n nA complete victory for marriage equality could be a year away nCourt strikes down Oregon's same-sex marriage ban nMarriage equality's 10-year journey, in one stunning GIF nNational Organization for Marriage asks Supreme Court to stop Oregon same-sex marriages n
