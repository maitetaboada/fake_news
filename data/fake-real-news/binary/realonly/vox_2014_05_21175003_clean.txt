Americans' support for same-sex marriage continued its decades-long rise to a record high in May, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday. n n n nThe poll found support for same-sex marriage is rising among all age groups, but particularly among young people. n n n nA majority of Democrats and Independents support allowing same-sex marriages, while Republicans still lag behind the national trend. n n n nAll political ideologies support same-sex marriages more now than decades ago, although liberals and moderates report much more support for marriage equality. n n n nUpdate: The first chart in this post was originally a bar graph that could be misinterpreted to show constantly rising support. It has since been changed to Gallup's line chart.
