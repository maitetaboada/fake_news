A federal judge on Monday ruled that Ohio must recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages, The Associated Press reported. nThis puts Ohio in a relatively unique situation: the state does not allow same-sex unions, but it will be required to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states where it is legal, like Massachusetts and New York. The only other state that recognizes but does not allow same-sex marriages is Oregon. nIf the ruling stands, same-sex couples living in Ohio but married outside the state will have access to benefits provided to other married couples. Same-sex couples, for example, would be able to make medical decisions for their partners and share property rights. nBut Judge Timothy Black signaled that he will put his decision on hold while state officials appeal the ruling. If Ohio leaders lose in their attempts to appeal, the ruling will stand as the permanent law of the state. nUpdate: Black put the ruling on hold for everyone except the four same-sex couples involved in the lawsuit, reported The Columbus Dispatch.
