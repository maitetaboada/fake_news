A federal judge late Tuesday deemed Idaho's ban on same-sex marriages unconstitutional. nUS District Magistrate Candy Dale issued an injunction on Idaho's voter-approved constitutional ban on same-sex marriages. But the ruling was later put on hold by a higher court as the case works through the appeals process, BuzzFeed reported. nThe Republican-controlled state government disputed Dale's ruling. n"In 2006, the people of Idaho exercised their fundamental right, reaffirming that marriage is the union of a man and a woman," Idaho Governor Butch Otter said in a statement reported by KTVB. "Today's decision, while disappointing, is a small setback in a long-term battle that will end at the U.S. Supreme Court. I am firmly committed to upholding the will of the people and defending our Constitution." nThis is just the latest in a series of court rulings against different states' legislative and constitutional bans on same-sex marriages. Last week, an Arkansas state judge struck down that state's bans and allowed hundreds of same-sex couples to get married. And earlier this year a federal judge in Ohio ordered the state to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages, before putting the decision on hold as it works through the appeals process. nUpdate: Updated this post to reflect the appeals court's decision to stay the ruling.
