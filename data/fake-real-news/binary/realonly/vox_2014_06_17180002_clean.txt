The literary community seemingly can't go five years without someone notable declaring the novel dead. nThe novel is a relatively newÂ literary format. Though fictional storytelling has been a tradition since the Greek and Roman empires, the first precursor to the modern novel was Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote in 1605. Â The form truly came to popular prominence in the 18th century through writers like Henry Fielding and Daniel Defoe. Many scholars, such as Margaret Anne Doody, cite the 18th century as the beginning of "the novel" we know today, because of the rise in literary criticism that happened during the same period, but the novel's creation date is still a matter of heated debate. nAs, apparently, is the date of its death. Critics have been declaring the form dead for nearly a century now. And decades of past failed predictions don't seem to deter people from repeating them.
