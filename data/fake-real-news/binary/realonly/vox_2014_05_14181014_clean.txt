Almost all of America's bans on same-sex marriage are being contested in court, with only two states escaping LGBT activists' challenges so far. n n n nThe map, compiled with information from Lambda Legal and other media reports, shows only North Dakota and Montana's bans aren't being actively challenged. nSince the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down the federal ban on same-sex marriages, judges have unanimously come down in favor of same-sex marriage rights in several states. This includes cases in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. But the rulings have all been put on hold as they work through the appeals process. n n n nThe widespread challenges and their successes are why so many LGBT activists and opponents see another Supreme Court showdown on same-sex marriage as nearly inevitable. As court cases continue piling up in favor of same-sex marriage, the nation's highest court will eventually have to speak up about whether all these lower courts are getting their rulings right or wrong. nUpdate: Updated to reflect developments in Idaho, Arkansas, Oregon, and Pennsylvania.
