A school shooter attacked Reynolds High School in Portland, Oregon on June 10, killingÂ at least one student.

Everytown for Gun Safety/Mark Gongloff n nThe data comes from Everytown for Gun Safety, aÂ recently formed gun control advocacy group. Everytown defines school shooting as "assaults, homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings" that take place "inside a school building or on school or campus grounds." Huffington Post editor Mark GongloffÂ mapped Everytown's data and tweeted it out. nIt's hard to find statistically reliable research about school shootings, but there's no doubt gun violence is still a serious problem in America. Despite the fact that the gun homicide death has declined substantially in the past two decades, Â about 11,000 Americans are still killed every year in firearm homicides. About 19,000 die in gun suicides. nThat's a much higher rate than anywhere else in the developed world. The causes are complicated, but there's mounting evidence that America's loose gun laws contribute to both theÂ suicide andÂ homicide problem. nYou might also be interested in: n nOne map that puts America's gun violence epidemic in perspective n12 questions about Bowe Bergdahl n40 maps that explain the Middle East n40 maps that explain food in America n
