Colorado's marijuana sales continued trending up in April, and at least some of that can be attributed to the celebration of the stoner holiday 4/20. nThe state's revenue for marijuana sales, a bulk of which comes from Denver, climbed from nearly $19 million in March to more than $22 million in April. n n n nThe gains can be in part attributed to 4/20 nSome of this can be attributed to the first celebration of 4/20 since recreational sales began in Colorado. Hotels.com, after all, reported that hotel searches were up 73 percent for the weekend of 4/20 compared to the same time period last year. So it stands to reason that tourists and residents alike brought in extra revenue through the celebrations. nthere's good reason to believe this increase could continue nBut there's good reason to believe this increase could continue. For one, revenues from marijuana sales have been steadily rising all year. nAs Ron Kammerzell, director of enforcement at the Colorado Department of Revenue, previously pointed out, there are still more than 100 recreational marijuana shops looking to open in Colorado â€" some of which are in cities and counties where marijuana isn't sold at all yet. As more local jurisdictions allow these shops to open, it stands to reason that revenue will increase. nA lot of the tax revenue will go to schools nBy voter rule, $40 million of the tax revenue raised through marijuana sales is required to go to schools. The Colorado Department of Revenue estimates that about $1.9 million of the $40 million has been raised so far. nIn total, the state has netted more than $11 million from recreational pot alone. nThe large gathering of stoners came and went without public safety issues nAt the same time, it seems like the massive gathering of pot enthusiasts occurred with little to no public safety debacles. Unlike the 2013 celebration that was tragically marked by a shooting, there were no reports of major problems at this year's 4/20 celebrations. nViolent crime rates, in fact, continued trending down in Denver throughout April, as Vox previously reported. n n n nProperty crime rates dropped as well. n n n nAs other states watch Colorado's marijuana legalization experiment, these are the kind of numbers legalization supporters want to see. Not only is the state making money off a once-taboo drug, but it seems to be doing so with few problems. nFurther reading n n4/20, America's stoner holiday, explained nNo, legal pot hasn't turned Colorado into a crime-ridden wasteland nWhy people are freaking out about marijuana candy nThe public health case for legalizing pot: it could replace alcohol n n n n
