The form letter to cure all Harper government missteps - The Globe and Mail


Memo from the Office of Prime Minister Stephen Harper: In an effort to streamline the process, the Conservative Party of Canada has produced a form letter for ministerial apologies.

We have given this matter serious consideration and hope (not unreasonably, the Prime Minister would like to stress) that this form covers every conceivable eventuality. Ministers are asked to please fill out the form 7 to 21 days after the need arises.

Dear[choose one]/i&gt;,

It has come to my attention that questions have been raised about[choose one]/i&gt;

I would like to take this opportunity to assure you that I have thoroughly investigated the [choose one]/i&gt;,

and that the events in question [choose one]/i&gt;

I want to be clear that I take full responsibility for the thing of which I still only have the vaguest knowledge, and about which I was quoted out of context. And I am [choose one]/i&gt;

I ask that you please accept [choose one]/i&gt;

This morning, I offered my resignation to the Prime Minister and he[choose one]/i&gt;

Seriously, can you [choose one]/i&gt;

I really do not think there is a better man to lead this country in a strong, stable majority than [choose one]/i&gt;

No one is sorrier than I am to be asked to be this sorry, but I would remind Canadians of the [choose one]/i&gt;

At this juncture we can all agree on the need to move forward. Hindsight is always 20/20, but at the time the unfortunate decision was made I was [choose one]/i&gt;

Sincerely,

______ , Minister of _______.
