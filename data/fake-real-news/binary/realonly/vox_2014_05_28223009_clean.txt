On Wednesday, Apple confirmed that it was buying the headphone and streaming music company Beats, the lovechild of rap genius Dr. Dre and part-time American Idol judge Jimmy Iovine, forÂ $3 billion. n "Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s like finding the precise grain of sand on the beach. Theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re rare and very hard to find," Tim Cook said about the acquisition, as though people go to the beach hoping to find precise grains of sand. nBroken analogies aside, people were already ready to chime in and have a little fun with theÂ most expensive acquisition in Apple history.Â The AP helped fuel the fire with this (unintentionally) hilarious tweet: n nBREAKING: Apple seeks to regain cool with $3 billion purchase of headphone maker, music streamer Beats nâ€" The Associated Press () May 28, 2014n n n n nThat opened up a whole different avenue of jokes at Apple's expense. n nBrian "seeks to regain cool" with $29.99 purchase of cargo shorts. nâ€" Brian Ries () May 28, 2014n n n n nThere were alsoÂ Mad Men: n nThere's just one condition: Beats has to keep Ted Chaough nâ€" Dan Amira () May 28, 2014n n n n nAnd even some sardonic digs at some tech punditry: n nStill can't believe Dre killed the Beats deal by bragging about it.
