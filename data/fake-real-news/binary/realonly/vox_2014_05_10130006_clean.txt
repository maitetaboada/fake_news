Mother's Day is nearly here. nSure, the holiday has kinda drifted from anÂ idealized celebration of the mother-child bond to aÂ corporate-driven occasion for mass consumption, but that shouldn't overshadow how important moms fundamentally are. nScience has told us all sorts of fascinating things about the uniquely intimate link between mother and child at the biological level. n1) Babies begin listening to their mothers' speech in the womb nIn 2013, scientists conducted anÂ interesting study with 80 newborns inÂ Tacoma, Washington and Stockholm, Sweden: they played them sounds in English, Swedish, or other languages. nthe neurological mechanisms for hearing develop around 30 weeks after conception nIt's well-known thatÂ infants find novel experiences more interesting, so the scientists wanted to see if the babies would be more interested in noises in languages other than their mothers'. As it turns out, they did â€" the newborns could control how long the sounds played by sucking on a pacifier, and they consistently sucked more for sounds in languages other than their own. nThe researchers propose that the newborns registered and habituated to their own mothers' speech in the womb â€"Â  a reasonable conclusion, given that the neurological mechanisms needed for hearing are known to develop at around 30 weeks after conception. n2) A mother's saliva might be good for a baby's health n nBSIP/UIG Via Getty Images nFor years, some mothers whose babies dropped their pacifiers on the ground might pick it up, suck it clean, and pop it back in the infant's mouth. Experts (including theÂ New York City Department of Health) widelyÂ recommended against doing this. nsharing spit may expose babies to crucial microbes nBut this year, Swedish researchers came toÂ an unexpected finding about this seemingly gross habit â€" parents who do it have kids with significantly lower rates of allergies, eczema, asthma, and other auto-immune diseases. nThis is only a correlation, not a causation, butÂ it fits in with the hygiene hypothesis: the idea that recent increases in many auto-immune diseases are the result of an over-sanitized childhood environment, which prevents a kid's immune system from learning how to differentiate between trivial threats and serious ones. Sharing spit may be one way of exposing a baby to these crucial microbes. n3) Breast milk confers all sorts of immune system benefits â€" and may even protect against HIV nBreast milk is widely known to provide all sorts of nutritional benefits that can't be matched by formula. One of these is the boost it gives to a baby's immune system: because of the antibodies that are transmitted through a mother's milk, breastfed babies areÂ more resistant to infections of the respiratory system and digestive tract during early childhood. na protein in breast milk binds to the virus and inhibits it nBut recently, scientists have discovered that breast milk canÂ protect against a very different sort of infection: HIV. nWorldwide, only about 10 to 20 percent of infants breastfed by mothers with HIV catch the virus, andÂ new research has identified the reason. A protein called Tenascin-C, naturally present in all breast milk, binds to the virus and prevents it from attacking human cells. nIt doesn't prevent HIV spread in all cases, but most of them. This, along with the enormous nutritional advantages of breast milk, areÂ why the UN recently began advising HIV-positive mothers to breastfeed, as long as they're taking antiretroviral medicines. n4) For premature babies, skin-to-skin contact with a mother improves health nHaving a mother hold a premature baby closely against her chest for at least a few hours a day â€" a practice calledÂ kangaroo care â€" is practiced at an increasing number of hospital neonatal care units, because of research showing that it provides all sorts of health benefits to newborns. nkangaroo care can help premature babies gain weight faster nCompared to strictly keeping premature babies in incubators, studiesÂ have found that daily kangaroo care can help them gain weight faster, be more resistant to infections and hypothermia, and experience less pain during uncomfortable procedures, like heel lancing. nThe really interesting thing is that scientists still don't fully understand how kangaroo care provides these benefits. It only seems to work when the baby is naked (or wearing a diaper) and is held directly against a mother (or father's) bare skin. It's possible that skin-to-skin contact uniquely stimulates release of theÂ hormone oxytocin in both the baby and mother, but scientists still aren't sure. n5) A mother's brain may contain cells from her children n nJohn Greim/LightRocket via Getty Images nDuring pregnancy, the placenta links the mother and fetus, allowing nutrients to flow from mother to fetus and waste to move in the opposite direction. The organ is built from cells from both of them, and the cellsÂ can migrate through it, ultimately ending up and multiplying for years in the other's body. nAn estimated 50 percent of mothers have their children's cells inside them nFor this reason, anÂ estimated 50 percent of mothers have their children's cells inside them â€" most often embedded in her skin and in organsÂ like her lungs, liver, and kidneys. A mother's cells can also end up in her child, although this is a bit less common. nInterestingly, scientistsÂ have recently found that in many cases, a child's cells can migrate all the way to a mother's brain. Their research has also shown that women with more of these cells haveÂ lower rates of Alzheimer's, for reasons that are still unclear. n6) The word "mother" might date to the end of the Ice Age nThis one isn't exactly biology â€" but it's a fascinating bit of science about the concept of motherhood anyway. nRecently, a team of linguists analyzed cognates shared by a big range of different language families, including Uralic (which includes Finnish and Hungarian), Dravidian (which includes South Indian languages), and Inuit-Yupik (which includes Arctic languages). nback when wooly mammoths roamed the earth, humans said the word similar to how we do today nBy mapping the words' relationships and using what we already know about the rates at which languages mutate over time,Â they found that there are at least 23 "ultraconserved words" that are shared between all these languages because they've changed relatively little since about 15,000 years ago.Â In other words, back when glaciers still covered most of Europe and North America and woolly mammoths roamed the Earth, humans were saying these words in a way pretty similar to how we do today. nAmong them: fire, worm, old, spit, and, of course, mother. nThe fact that our ancestors were saying mother so long ago might not be a huge shock. But its inclusion on a list of very quotidian physical objects is interesting â€" and hints at how essential mothers really are to the human experience as a whole.
