Today marks the 10th anniversary of marriage equality in Massachusetts. On May 17, 2004, the state became the first to issue same-sex marriage licenses â€" just a few months after its Supreme Court said denying same-sex couples the right to marry was unconstitutional. nSince then, LGBT advocates have made a lot of progress. Today, 17 states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage. And many states have edged closer to marriage equality after recent court rulings. Watch all that progress happen in this amazing GIF. (Note that it includes courts' partial and full repeals.) n n n
