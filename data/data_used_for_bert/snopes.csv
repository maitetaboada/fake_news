The bust, which was part of ""Operation Rescue"" had identified 670 suspects and 230 abused children in over 30 countries, had now taken to many victims to safety.        Officials say that 184 people had been arrested with investigations in some countries still ongoing.    According to one witness who worked at summer youth camps, suspected the abuse of some 100 children had been going on ""for years.""     press    Most of the pedophile ring member detained are thought to have direct involvement in sexually abusing children.    Suspects include scout leaders, teachers, and even police officers according to AP.    Europol director Rob Wainwright said it was probably the largest online pedophile network in the world.""    According to NBCNews : The father of Pacific castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga said he was told his long-lost son vanished on a fishing trip but he didnt have the heart to break the news to his ailing wife.    Cori Bassett, a public affairs officer for U.S.    Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email that there had been five arrests and four convictions in connection with Operation Rescue in the U.S.    ""Arrests so far have been made in Georgia and Connecticut. ICE continues to pursue the leads provided by Europol,"" she added.    The website was shut down following the three-year investigation, Europol said.    ""The website operated from a server based in the Netherlands and, at its height, boasted up to 70,000 members worldwide,"" it added.     press    ""It attempted to operate as a 'discussiononly' forum where people could share their sexual interest in young boys without committing any specific offenses, thus operating 'below the radar' of police attention,"" Europol said. ""Having made contact on the site, some members would move to more private channels, such as email, to exchange and share illegal images and films of children being abused. Computers seized from those arrested have harvested huge quantities of child abuse images and videos,"" it added.    Police infiltrated site    The Europol statement said U.K. and Australian police infiltrated the site to identify the members who posed the greatest danger to children.    Police also sometimes posed as children online as part of the investigation.    Law enforcement authorities from 13 countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain and the U.K., were involved in the case, Europol said.    The statement said Europol analysts had cracked the security features of a key computer server at the center of the network which uncovered the identities of suspected child sex offenders.    And, after his arrest, the forum's Dutch administrator helped police break encryption measures that shielded users' identities, allowing police to begin their covert investigations.    ""Europol subsequently issued over 4,000 intelligence reports to police authorities in over 30 countries in Europe and elsewhere, which has led to the arrests of suspects and the safeguarding of children,"" Europol said.    Wainwright said he was proud of the ""exceptional work of our experts in helping police authorities around the world to record these groundbreaking results.""    ""The safeguarding of so many vulnerable children is particularly rewarding and demonstrates the commitment of our agency to make Europe a safer place for its citizens,"" he added.    The investigation was led by Britain's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Center.    Peter Davies, of the center, said there would be more arrests as the investigations continue.    ""Those who have been members of the site can expect a knock on the door in the very near future,"" he said.    In Britain, police said, the children involved were aged between 7 and 14.    Australian Federal Police commander Grant Edwards said suspects arrested in Australia ranged in age from 19 to 84 and used the Internet to ""prey on children with anonymity, with subterfuge and with camouflage.""    Children, Edwards said, ""should be able to use the Internet safely, without fear of being approached or groomed by these online predators."" ","A recent international investigation resulted in the shutting down of an online pedophilia forum with some 70,000 members worldwide.",test

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/banner-purchase/http://taxfoundation.org/blog/happy-flag-day-14-states-exempt-flags-their-sales-taxes-0,mixture," Today is Flag Day, the anniversary of when 19-year-old Wisconsin teacher Bernard J. Cigrand asked his students to write essays on the U.S. flag and its significance. This fell on the anniversary of the Continental Congresss vote in 1777 to adopt the Stars and Stripes, and since 1949, Flag Day has been honored every June 14.    To accompany todays theme, we note that 14 states exempt the purchase of U.S. or their states flags from their sales tax. Such an exemption is poor tax policy: states have exempted nearly 60% of consumer sales from sales tax (more than half), often for political reasons. At the same time, many business inputs are subject to tax, meaning that some retail items are taxed multiple times and some (like flags in 14 states) not at all. This micromanagement of consumer decisions disrupts what would otherwise be decisions made on economic factors, not tax incentives or government prodding.    Take West Virginia, for instance. Their exemption for flags is the 49th item in a lengthy list of exemptions. In Vermont, its merely the 33rd, but they throw in the wrinkle that its only exempt if sold to (or by) a veterans organization. Another reminder to keep by the register of Vermont flag vendors.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bee-species-endangered/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/6aa3e8d015f2465da8fe313e4abb94de/feds-list-7-hawaii-bee-species-endangered-first-us,mixture," HONOLULU Federal authorities on Friday added seven yellow-faced bee species, Hawaii's only native bees, for protection under the Endangered Species Act, a first for any bees in the United States.    The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced the listing after years of study by the conservation group Xerces Society, state government officials and independent researchers. The Xerces Society says its goal is to protect nature's pollinators and invertebrates, which play a vital role in the health of the overall ecosystem.    The nonprofit organization was involved in the initial petitions to protect the bee species, said Sarina Jepson, director of endangered species and aquatic programs for the Portland, Oregon-based group.    Jepson said yellow-faced bees can be found elsewhere in the world, but these particular species are native only to Hawaii and pollinate plant species indigenous to the islands.    The bees face a variety of threats including ""feral pigs, invasive ants, loss of native habitat due to invasive plants, fire, as well as development, especially in some for the coastal areas,"" Jepson told The Associated Press.    The bees can be found in a wide variety of habitats in Hawaii, from coastal environments to high-elevation shrub lands, she said. The yellow-faced bees pollinate some of Hawaii's endangered native plant species. While other bees could potentially pollinate those species, many could become extinct if these bees were to die off entirely.    Hawaii-based entomologist Karl Magnacca worked with Xerces on much of the initial research. It has taken almost 10 years to get to this point, he told the AP. ""It's good to see it to finally come to fruition,"" he said.    The bees ""tend to favor the more dominant trees and shrubs we have here,"" he said. ""People tend to focus on the rare plants, and those are important, that's a big part of the diversity. But the other side is maintaining the common ones as common. (The bees) help maintain the structure of the whole forest.""    Magnacca added that there are a lot more rare insects that deserve protection. ""It may not necessarily be appropriate to list them as endangered, but we have this huge diversity that we need to work on and protect here in Hawaii,"" he said. ""There's a huge amount of work that needs to be done.""    The bees are critical for maintaining the health of plants and other animals across the islands, said Gregory Koob, conservation and restoration team manager for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Honolulu.    There is no designated critical habitat attached to the listing, he said, but the protection will allow authorities to implement recovery programs, access funding and limit their harm from outside sources. All federal agencies must consult with the Fish and Wildlife service when interacting with endangered species.    ""As an animal, it can't be taken or harmed or killed by individuals,"" Koob said. ""Any research that is done needs a permit from Fish and Wildlife Service unless it's done by a state agency.""    Koob said that if the bees were removed from ecosystem, the plants that they pollinate would likely not survive.    ""Those plants are not only food and nesting habitat for the bees, but they also provide habitat for other animals,"" he said. ""It's the web of life.""    Friday's listing finalized the protection of 10 animal species in Hawaii, the seven bees along with the band-rumped storm-petrel, the orangeblack Hawaiian damselfly and the anchialine pool shrimp. It also added 39 species of plants native to Hawaii.    The rusty-patched bumble bee, found widely across the continental United States, is also being considered for protection.    ___    Find more stories by AP's Caleb Jones at _LINKS_ Follow Jones on Twitter: _LINKS_ ",Bees have been classified as an endangered species.,test

We have plenty of space in our country, but insufficient resources to support everyone who wants to come here. When we see innocent children used as political pawns, it still tugs at our heartstrings, which is the desired intent. The real question is: What are we going to do about it? Immigration reform has been a very tough issue, as well as a political football, and it has produced governmental stalemates and no useful solutions for decades.    President Obamas decision to act unilaterally outside of Congress is not the answer. Instead, Congress must use its lawmaking powers to fix a system that is so broken that only a legislative solution can fix it. The lack of policy progress has been incredibly frustrating, and the humanitarian border crisis this summer only highlighted how badly we need a system that deals efficiently and effectively with both illegal and legal immigration.    It is time for Congress to act and to do so in a bipartisan fashion that engenders the confidence of the American people. There are many common-sense prescriptions within reach of our government. It is time to seize them.    To begin to solve this problem, we must first have some understanding of why it exists. Despite all of its problems, America is still the place of dreams. As such, it is small wonder that so many from other nations would like to live here.    Right now, we have very porous borders and unenthusiastic and inconsistent enforcement of immigration laws. Further incentives for illegal immigration are easy enrollment in public schools, easy employment for those willing to take jobs others dont want, easy access to health care and easy acquisition of public support through welfare programs. Yet this population cannot participate in the formal workforce, which means they cannot contribute fully to their local economies.    Any discussion of immigration reform should include bipartisan solutions that both address the undocumented population here today and discourage illegal immigration going forward. If these issues are not addressed, solutions will fall short. On the other hand, if all of these issues are addressed firmly and consistently, we can uphold the rule of law and discourage further illegal immigration. Detractors will say that if it were that simple, it already would have been done and we wouldnt be having this discussion. What they fail to account for is the fact that the issues have not been addressed.    A national guest-worker program makes sense and seems to work well in Canada. Non-citizens would have to apply for a guest-worker permit and have a guaranteed job awaiting them. Taxes would be paid at a rate commensurate with other U.S. workers, and special visas would allow for easy entry and egress across borders. Guest-worker status would be granted to individuals and not to groups.    People already here illegally could apply for guest-worker status from outside of the country. This means they would have to leave first. They should in no way be rewarded for having broken our laws, but if they are wise, they will arrange with their employer before they leave to immediately offer them a legal job as soon as their application is received. When they return, they still would not be U.S. citizens, but they would be legal, and they would be paying taxes. Only jobs that are vacant as a result of a lack of interest by American citizens should be eligible for the guest-worker program.    In return for greater certainty on immigration, employers must bear some responsibility for making sure that no illegal immigrants are hired. Employers who break the rules should receive swift, severe and consistent punishment that constitutes a real deterrent and not a mere inconvenience. A second infraction should be a criminal offense and treated as such.    All of this is irrelevant unless we have secure borders. There is much that can be learned from security personnel in prisons and other secured facilities, and there is a great deal of smart technology that can be employed to achieve secure borders. It is a matter of will rather than ability.    As long as we reward people who break laws, they will continue to break laws. We do need a continual flow of immigrants, but choosers need not be beggars. We make decisions based on our needs. People who refuse to comply with the rules must forfeit chances of legalization in the future. Anyone caught involved in voter fraud should be immediately deported and have his citizenship revoked. The point is this: We must create a system that disincentivizes illegal immigration and upholds the rule of law while providing us with a steady stream of immigrants from other nations who will strengthen our society.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bob-marley-cia/https://web.archive.org/web/20171201183322/http://yournewswire.com/cia-agent-deathbed-bob-marley/,ffalse," A 79-year-old retired officer of the CIA, Bill Oxley, has made a series of stunning confessions since he was admitted to the Mercy Hospital in Maine on Monday and told he has weeks to live. He claims he committed 17 assassinations for the American government between 1974 and 1985, including the music icon Bob Marley.    Mr. Oxley, who worked for the CIA for 29 years as an operative with top-level security clearances, claims he was often used as a hitman by the organization, to assassinate individuals who could represent a threat to the goals of the agency.    Trained as a sniper and marksman, Mr. Oxley also has significant experience with more unconventional methods of inflicting harm upon others, like poisons, explosives, induced heart attacks and cancer.    The 79-year-old operative claims he committed the assassinations between March 1974 and August 1985, at a time when he says the CIA was a law unto itself. He says he was part of an operative cell of three members which carried out political assassinations across the country and occasionally in foreign countries.    Most of their victims were political activists, journalists, and union leaders, but he also confesses to assassinating a few scientists, medical researchers, artists and musicians whose ideas and influence represented a threat to the interests of the United States.    He claims he had no problem with going through with the assassination of Bob Marley, because I was a patriot, I believed in the CIA, and I didnt question the motivation of the agency. Ive always understood that sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the greater good.    But Mr. Oxley confesses that Bob Marley remains unique among his victims, as he was the only victim he felt anything for.    The others were assholes. Bob Marley was Bob Marley. I was no closer to being a long-haired hippy back then than I am now, but I must admit Bobs music did move me. It held some power over me.    He claims to have mixed feelings about Bob Marleys death. On the one hand, Marley was a good man, a beautiful soul with profound artistic gifts who did not deserve to have his life cut short. But according to Mr. Oxley, Bob Marley was also placing the goals of the CIA in jeopardy and threatening the existence of the United States:    He was succeeding in creating a revolution that used music as a more powerful tool than bullets and bombs. Bob Marley in 1976 was a very serious threat to the global status quo and to the hidden power brokers implementing their plan for a new world order. As far as the agency was concerned, Bob Marley was too successful, too famous, too influential A Jamaican Rastaman who started using his funds and fame to support causes around the world that were in direct conflict with the CIA To be honest, he signed his own death warrant.    Its not like we didnt warn him. We sent a few guys to shoot up his house in Kingston, Mr Oxley says, referring to a shooting in the Marley residence that left the singer with an injured arm and chest. We had a message for him. We impressed upon him the gravity of the situation he found himself in. He didnt listen.    Two days later, in the mountains, I stuck him with the pin.    How Bob Marley was murdered by the CIA    Two days after Bob Marley was shot in the left arm by one of three gunmen who ambushed the singer and some of his crew in his house in Kingston, and after a brief stint in hospital, Bob Marley travelled to the protective hills of the Blue Mountains and spent time at the highest point in Jamaica, rehearsing for an upcoming concert.    According to Mr. Oxley, he used press credentials to gain access to Bob Marley during his Blue Mountains retreat. He introduced himself as a famous photographer working for the New York Times, and gave Bob Marley a gift.    I gave him a pair of Converse All Stars. Size 10. When he tried on the right shoe, he screamed out OUUUCH.    That was it. His life was over right there and then. The nail in the shoe was tainted with cancer viruses and bacteria. If it pierced his skin, which it did, it was goodnight nurse.    There had been a series of high-profile assassinations of counter-culture figures in the United States in the late sixties, early seventies. By the time Bob Marleys time came around, we thought subtlety was the order of the day. No more bullets and splattered brains.    Mr. Oxley says he kept close contact with Marley during the final years of his life, ensuring the medical advice he received in Paris, London and the United States would hasten his demise rather than cure him. He died from cancer in May 1981. He was just 36 years old.    The last time I saw Bob before he died he had removed the dreadlocks, and his weight was dropping like a stone, he says.    He was very withdrawn, unbelievably small. He was shrinking in front of us. The cancer had done its job.    The day he died in Miami was definitely one of the most difficult moments in my career. I felt real bad. For a long time I wasnt comfortable with my part in his death. But eventually I came to realize it had to be done, for America.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/california-laundry-and-shower/https://archive.fo/AvQJc#selection-827.0-843.165,mfalse," Governor Jerry Brown is retiring but not before he passes a few draconian laws as parting gifts for California. Two bills were signed into law on Thursday of last week to help California be better prepared for future droughts and the effects of climate change.    The mandatory water conservation standards will be permanent, according to their wording, and not just for use in times of crisis. To make a long story short, now that these bills are law, its illegal to take a shower and do a load of laundry in the same day because youll exceed your ration.    Heres the wording of the new laws.    Senate Bill 606 establishes a governing body to oversee all water suppliers, both private and public and will require extensive paperwork from those utility companies.    Assembly Bill 1668 is where it gets personal. This establishes limits on indoor water usage for every person in California and the amount allowed will decrease even further over the next 12 years.    The bill, until January 1, 2025, would establish 55 gallons per capita daily as the standard for indoor residential water use, beginning January 1, 2025, would establish the greater of 52.5 gallons per capita daily or a standard recommended by the department and the board as the standard for indoor residential water use, and beginning January 1, 2030, would establish the greater of 50 gallons per capita daily or a standard recommended by the department and the board as the standard for indoor residential water use. The bill would impose civil liability for a violation of an order or regulation issued pursuant to these provisions, as specified.    If youre wondering how the government would know how much water your family is using, the utility providers will be obligated to rat you out of face massive fines. And theyre encouraged to spy in all sorts of creative ways. They shall use satellite imagery, site visits, or other best available technology to develop an accurate estimate of landscaped areas.    Some analysis    Now, if youre wondering where I get my assertion that you cant shower and do laundry on the same day, heres some math:    An 8-minute shower uses about 17 gallons of water    A load of laundry uses about 40 gallons of water    A bathtub holds 80 to 100 gallons of water    A dishwasher uses 6 gallons of water    There are also standards to be established for outdoor use such as landscaping, caring for livestock, and gardening, but those numbers dont seem to be available at this time. Maybe Californians just get to wait in suspense to see if their chickens are allowed to have water on the same day as their vegetables. Back when I lived in California, we were only allowed to water our gardens two times per week, which, in that heat, as you can imagine, didnt lead to very productive gardens.    Farmers on a larger scale will have to jump through numerous hoops and create water management plans which must then be approved by the people in suits because obviously, theyll know more about the needs of crops and livestock than the farmers will    Oh, and dont worry, rich people. There will be provisions for swimming pools, spas, and other water features. So you can still have your pretty fountains and pools while the rest of the peons take 2 showers a week. One might wonder if variances will apply to the wealthy for their landscaping needs.    The State Water Resources Control Board, which will oversee local agencies progress, will also consider possible variances for some districts that need additional allowances due to specific local circumstances. ( source    What if you dont comply?    If you dont plan to comply its going to be way cheaper to move. Here are the fines Californians will be looking at and its not a typo these fines are PER DAY.    (1) If the violation occurs in a critically dry year immediately preceded by two or more consecutive below normal, dry, or critically dry years or during a period for which the Governor has issued a proclamation of a state of emergency under the California Emergency Services Act (Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 8550) of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code) based on drought conditions, ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each day in which the violation occurs. (2) For all violations other than those described in paragraph (1), one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each day in which the violation occurs.    Its important to note that your usage is only tracked if you have municipal water. If you have a well, at this point, you will probably be okay. Back when I lived there, the idea of metering private wells and billing the owners for use had been floated around, but most people resisted and it wasnt enforced. If you truck your water in, you can also use as much as you need to.    For years it was illegal to use greywater systems in California, despite the epic droughts. Those regulations have been loosened, however, compliance is still extremely onerous. ( Get the details here .) And rainwater catchment is not only legal, its encouraged. In fact, theres a ballot on the table that is a measure to allow rainwater capture systems to be installed without counting as new construction for the purposes of reassessing property taxes.    Dont think this only affects California    Not only are Californians fleeing the state in droves, but there are other ways these restrictive laws can affect the rest of us directly.    These stringent measures set a dangerous precedent for the rest of the country.    There could be a shortage of food coming out of California because there isnt enough water to produce it.    The food we do get from there will cost a lot more.    Its important to pay attention to stuff like this and not shrug it off because I dont live in California. In an economy such as ours, were all interlinked. A draconian law that gains a footing in one part of the country is much easier to pass in other parts.

Who declared medicinal marijuana safe and it does not have any health risks. Instead it is beneficial for diseases like epilepsy, cancer, Parkinsons, Alzheimers and many other diseases. Now isnt that the sweetest news?? Medicinal Marijuana now being advocated by the World health organization The organization has found also that medicinal marijuana is not addictive and that CBD or cannabidiol which is one of the main relaxant properties in Cannabis should not be even considered a scheduled drug. Image Source: wwwe.stackpathdns.com WHO says Medicinal Marijuana not a scheduled drug and can treat epilepsy Medicinal Cannabis is currently legal in 29 states. Although health experts warn research is too juvenile to rule out side effects, WHO have established the contrary. After several months of their own investigative research, the world health body has declared that CBD can help treat epilepsy without the risk of addiction. The Organization will also run a complete review of cannabis and its related substances in 2018. Physicians and the medicinal marijuana industry have been eagerly awaiting something like this which will speed up the legalization of Marijuana in the entire country. Image Source: www.india.com Path-breaking conclusion after years of research If by chance, the World Health Organization declared cannabis to be a scheduled drug that would become a huge obstacle for physicians from prescribing it as a treatment worldwide. WHOs report published on the 15th Dec 2017, also recommends rigid restrictions on fentanyl which is a synthetic opioid responsible for the deaths of thousands addicted to it. Image Source: www.pinimg.com The report also speaks of the current interest of the member states in the issue of using cannabis as medication. The report also says that WHO has spent years in collecting information and scientific evidence to support the benefits of medicinal marijuana, cannabis and its components. The report also concluded by saying that research on both animal and human subjects have proved that cannabis can be used for its therapeutic value in seizures because of epilepsy and related disorders. Image Source: www.tqn.com The man who proved it possible starting in Mexico The WHO report has made an important decision of not scheduling medicinal marijuana because there is no justification and reason to do so. It will not lead to addiction and hence is considered safe. Previously it was assumed that medicinal marijuana can cause addiction because of the substance THC which has psychoactive properties and induces a high.    Image Source: www.straitstimes.com.sg    One of the biggest advocates of legalizing medicinal marijuana is Mexican Raul Elizade who fought to be allowed to treat his daughter suffering from epilepsy. When Raul heard the decision of the WHO, he was overwhelmed. The man was instrumental in influencing the Mexican government to legalize medicinal marijuana. This allowed him to treat his daughter Grace who suffered almost a hundred seizures a day. Today she suffers only a few after the treatment.    Elizade, the founder and president of HempMeds Mexico said in an interview Im ecstatic that these international health leaders agree that CBD is a substance that should not be scheduled and has therapeutic value for a variety of medical conditions.     Image Source: www.ksat.com    WHO declares its official stance on medicinal marijuana, Says it is safe!    The World Health Organization had on Dec 14th declared official its stance on medicinal Marijuana being safe for the treatment of several types of disease. This is a definite shot in the arm for those still advocating the legalization of the medicinal use of the drug in various states of the USA where it still remains illegal.    Presently the US Department of Justices Drug Enforcement Administration regards marijuana as a Schedule I Controlled Substance, or has no currently accepted medical use in the US, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse.    Image Source: www.who.int    This is absolutely in contrary to what WHO has declared which may have many desperately in need of the drug for treatment more hopeful for its easy procurement and use.

Likewise, the Organization now advocates the use of medicinal Marijuana in Alzheimers, Crohns disease, certain cancers, Parkinsons and Epilepsy.    WHO says that Medicinal Marijuana is perfectly safe for use. This is undoubtedly the best news of the day.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dogs-jealousy-study/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094597,ftrue," It is commonly assumed that jealousy is unique to humans, partially because of the complex cognitions often involved in this emotion. However, from a functional perspective, one might expect that an emotion that evolved to protect social bonds from interlopers might exist in other social species, particularly one as cognitively sophisticated as the dog. The current experiment adapted a paradigm from human infant studies to examine jealousy in domestic dogs. We found that dogs exhibited significantly more jealous behaviors (e.g., snapping, getting between the owner and object, pushing/touching the object/owner) when their owners displayed affectionate behaviors towards what appeared to be another dog as compared to nonsocial objects. These results lend support to the hypothesis that jealousy has some primordial form that exists in human infants and in at least one other social species besides humans.    As discussed earlier, the proposed function of jealousy is to break-up a potentially threatening liaison and protect the primary relationship. This motivates several types of behaviors including approach actions such as attempts to get physically or psychologically between the attachment 3ure and the interloper, attending to the threatening interaction, seeking attention from the attachment figure, as well as indicators of negative emotion such as aggression, particularly toward the interloper [1] [2] , [8] , [10] [12] , [19] . Across social species, we would expect to see similar types of behaviors that serve the function of this motivational state. Therefore, the specific behaviors assessed in our experiment were based on studies of jealousy in non-verbal human infants and adults as well as behaviors described by dog owners and experts as indicative of jealousy.    To evaluate dogs' jealous behaviors, we modified a paradigm used to assess jealousy in 6-month-old infants [10] [12] . Thirty-six dogs were individually tested and videotaped while their owners ignored them and interacted with a series of three different objects. In the jealousy condition, the owner treated a stuffed dog, which briefly barked and wagged its tail, as if it were a real dog (e.g., petting, talking sweetly). In another condition, owners engaged in these same behaviors but did so towards a novel object (jack-o-lantern pail). This enabled us to test whether the elicitation of jealousy required that the owner show affection to an appropriate stimulus (what appeared to be a conspecific) or whether affectionate behaviors directed to a nonsocial stimulus would be enough to arouse jealous behaviors. In the third condition, the owner read aloud a children's book, which had pop-up pages and played melodies. This condition allowed us to test whether dogs' behaviors in the other conditions were indicative of jealousy per se (arising over the loss of affection and attention towards an interloper) or more general negative affect due to the loss of the owner's attention.    Although there are several reasons to predict that jealousy should lie within a dog's emotional repertoire, empirical evidence is lacking. The purpose of the present study was to construct a social situation and determine whether dogs, whose owners show affection to a potential interloper, engage in behaviors indicative of jealousy.    The idea that dogs are capable of jealousy is congenial to the burgeoning body of research on animal social cognition that reveals that dogs have sophisticated social-cognitive abilities. For example, dogs can use a variety of human communicative signals (e.g., pointing, eye gaze) to determine the location of hidden food [16] , are better at using social cues than chimpanzees [16] , show some sensitivity to reward inequity when a partner is rewarded and they are not [17] and appear aware of, and actively attempt to manipulate, the visual attention of their play partners [18] .    The functional account we are proposing would further predict that jealousy should occur not only in humans, but also in other social species in which emotional bonds between individuals develop and can be threatened by third parties. Interestingly, several observers of animal behavior, including Charles Darwin [13] , have suggested that jealousy may exist in other species, particularly in dogs. This possibility has also been underscored in a recent paper that had owners recount specific cases of their animals displaying emotions [14] . Descriptions of dog jealousy were fairly consistent across owners and always involved a social triangle. When the owners gave attention and affection to another person or animal, the dogs seemed to engage in attention-seeking behaviors (pushing against the owner or in between the owner and the rival, barking/growling/whining) and some showed aggression. Reports of the occurrence of jealousy in dogs was at least as common, if not more so, than some other emotions that are often considered more primary (anxiety and anger). However, despite such reports, experimental evidence demonstrating behavioral indices of jealousy in dogs does not exist. This type of empirical research seems particularly important, given that dog owners also report that their animals experience guilt but experimental work raises some doubt about whether dogs do show guilt [15] .    The theory that jealousy can take a primordial form finds support from the small but emerging body of research on human infant jealousy. Several studies [10] [12] found that infants as young as 6-months of age show behaviors indicative of jealousy, for example, when their mothers interacted with what appeared to be another infant (but was actually a realistic looking doll). The infants did not display the same behaviors when their mothers attend to a nonsocial item (a book).    One possibility is that jealousy first evolved in the context of sibling-parent relationships where dependent offspring compete for parental resources. An implication of this hypothesis is that jealousy may have a primordial or core form that can be triggered without complex cognition about the self or about the meaning of the social interaction [1] , [9] . This primordial form of jealousy may be elicited by the relatively simple perception that an attachment figure or loved one's attention has been captured by a potential usurper, which suffices to elicit a motive to regain the loved one's attention and block the liaison. Primordial jealousy may serve as the building block for jealousy elicited by more complex cognitive processes. For example, in adult human relationships, the experience of jealousy is greatly impacted by additional appraisals about the meaning of the interaction (e.g., does this mean my mate will leave me? Am I unloveable?). In both primordial and complex cases of jealousy, there is a motivation to restore the relationship and remove the usurper. However, in the latter case, interpretations of the situation play a large role in the elicitation and experience of the emotion.    The vast majority of research in this area has concentrated on jealousy within romantic relationships particularly over potential or actual infidelity. Hence, functional or evolutionary analysis of jealousy has focused on the fitness consequences of loss of a romantic or sexual relationship (e.g., cuckoldry, loss of resources) and on the psychological and behavioral effects of protecting such relationships [5] [7] . A broader functional view, however, would argue that jealousy evolved to secure resources not just in the context of sexual relationships, but also in any of a wide-range of valued relationships [1] , [8] . Accordingly, the same underlying emotional process that gives rise to jealousy in sexual relationships also produces jealousy in other types of bonds (e.g., friendships).    In humans, jealousy is an emotion with far-reaching psychological and social consequences. For example, it typically emerges as the third leading cause of non-accidental homicide across cultures [1] . While the origins and possible function of jealousy have been debated, most theorists agree on one defining feature: It requires a social triangle, arising when an interloper threatens an important relationship. A common assumption has been that the elicitation of jealousy involves, and perhaps requires, complex cognitive abilities [2] [3] , including appraisals about the meaning of the rival threat to one's self (e.g., self-esteem) and to one's relationship. For example, Lewis [4] has proposed that the emergence of jealousy requires the cognitive ability to reflect on the self and to understand conscious intentions.    In addition to assessing jealousy, we used this opportunity to explore attachment style in dogs (and its possible interaction with our conditions), which we mention here for the sake of completeness. We created a scale for owners to complete regarding their dog's attachment style and coded for behaviors that might be linked to different attachment styles. These included behaviors that might be indicative of anxiety (paw slightly raised; yawning) and of submission (ears back, tail down, and licking). We also attempted to code tail wagging to the left vs. the right because work by Quaranta, Siniscalchi, and Vallortigara [20] suggested that the former is associated with withdrawal and the latter with approach. However, our coders found this too difficult to assess via video. Analyses pertaining to attachment style are not reported here given their exploratory nature and the difficulty of measuring some of these behaviors.    During the post-interaction period, the owner put the object down and walked away. We coded four behaviors during this phase: 1) aggression/snapping directed at the object; 2) following the owner; 3) observing the object; and 4) ignoring the object. Due to the laborious nature of coding, we only coded for presence/absence of attention behaviors (observing/ignoring object) in this phase rather than assessing attention every 5 seconds as done in the condition phase. Additionally, in the dog condition, we noted if the dog sniffed the rear end of the toy dog. This was included as a measure of whether the dog perceived the stuffed dog as a real dog.    The preverbal human infant literature (e.g., by Hart and colleagues) suggests that jealousy produces increased interest and attention toward the mother. We assessed several behaviors pertaining to attention, which included 1) looking at the owner, 2) looking at the rival object, 3) orienting away from the owner, and 4) orienting away from the object. The first two categories were operationally defined as having the head turned and gaze directed toward the owner/object; the later two were operationally defined as having the head and body turned away from the owner/object. Due to their frequency across conditions, a simple present/absent code for the entire interaction period did not adequately capture these behaviors. Therefore, we performed more fined grained coding that consisted of denoting whether the behavior was present or absent every 5 seconds, resulting in total score that ranged from 012. Total scores were then transformed into proportion of time behavior was present. (In the cases where both raters coded the same dog's behavior, the average of the two coders' scores was used for these measures.)    The most common category of behavior in owner descriptions of their dogs' jealousy was attention seeking [14] . These behaviors often took the form of pushing the owner or attempting to get between the owner and the rival. We coded for both of these behaviors. Some owners also reported attempts by their dogs to shoo the rival away. In our coding scheme, we operationalized this as the dog pushing against the rival object. Another class of behaviors categorized as attention seeking by Morris et al. [14] was vocalizations (described as barking, growling, and whining), which we assessed. (Growling interrater reliability was lower than our .7 cutoff so was excluded from our analyses.)    We coded for aggression given its link to jealousy in human adults [1] and in owners' reports of dog jealousy [14] . Our primary measure of aggression was whether the dog attempted to bite/snap at the object. Coders also attempted to code more subtle signs of aggression that include lip curling (lips being held open with force in order to expose teeth), raised tailholding the tail up between the horizontal and vertical positions (an aggressive posture in wolves), and keeping the ears forward. Interrater reliability was low for ears forward (.57) and so this behavior was not analyzed. Our coders also reported difficulty assessing the raised tail in many dogs due to their physical characteristics (e.g., a clipped tail); however, interrater reliability was acceptable, so these analyses are reported in the results section. Lip curling was not seen across any condition.    Two raters, blind to the study's purpose, coded the videos. Unless otherwise noted, behaviors were coded as present or absent and are reported as percent of dogs showing such behaviors per condition. To compute interrater reliability, 29 dogs were coded by both raters. Behaviors in which interrater reliability was lower than .7 were not included in the analyses. For analyses that required whole numbers (i.e., Cochran's Test for presence/absence of a behavior), we used one rater's codes for half the dogs and the other rater's codes for the other half. Behaviors coded during the interaction of the owner with the object are described first, followed by the behaviors coded post-interaction.    In the book control condition, owners were instructed to read aloud a children's book, which popped up and played melodies, as if they were reading to a young child. Total amount of time the object made a noise was closely matched to that of the dog condition (approximately 8 secs).    Owners were instructed to interact with a realistic-looking stuffed dog that barked, whined, and wagged its tail (which lasted for a total of approximately 8 secs) when a button on the top of its head was pressed. The owners were asked to press the button only once and to interact with the stuffed dog as if they were playing with a real dog. They were also instructed to completely ignore their dog, which was present in the room for the duration of the interaction.    Owners were not aware of the hypotheses of the experiment. A within-subjects design was employed with order counter-balanced across participants. Each experimental condition was videotaped and lasted for 1 minute, followed by a 30 sec post-condition phase in which the owner set the object down within reach of the dog. The owner completed a questionnaire after each condition and then the dog and owner were given one minute to freely interact in order to reduce any potential carryover effects from the previous condition.    The initial sample size was n = 37. However, one male dog was excluded from all analyses due to a miscommunication between the owner and experimenter resulting in one condition ending prematurely. Therefore, the final sample size was n = 36. The mean age of the dogs was 32.2 months (range = 4135). Equal numbers of male and female dogs participated. The sample consisted of a variety of dog breeds as can be seen in Table 1 . Owners (31 females and 5 males) had owned their dogs an average of 25.4 months (range = 1134).    Dogs were tested individually at their homes and had to be less than 35 pounds or shorter than 15 inches. A size criterion was used because of the possibility that the jealousy manipulation would result in aggression and small dogs could be more easily controlled in such circumstances. Upon arrival at the subjects' homes, the experimenter obtained written consent from the dog owners for participation. The experimenter also gave a brief overview of the study stating, For this experiment, we are examining individual differences in dog behavior across various situations. Thus, we'll be asking you to act out various situations in front of your dog, while ignoring him or her, while we film his or her reaction."" The experimenter also said, ""If you think that your dog will act aggressively in this situation, we ask that you and your dog don't participate, but you'll still receive your Experimetrix [course] credit."" All owners chose to continue with the experiment.    This research was approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and by the University of California at San Diego Human Research Protections Program. Owners and pet dogs were recruited from the University of California, San Diego subject pool. Owners received partial course credit in psychology class for participation.    Results &amp; Discussion    Figure 1 shows the proportion of dogs that engaged in the various behaviors during the interactions with the objects in each condition. Our analyses showed significantly greater aggression in the jealousy condition, Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 12.80, p&lt; .002. One fourth of the dogs snapped at the object in the jealousy condition but only 1 dog did so in the other two conditions. (Results from follow up McNemar nonparametric tests are presented in Figure 1.) We, however, did not see a difference across conditions in the number of dogs that placed their tails between the vertical and horizontal positions (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = .67, ns). This may be due to our coders having difficulty accurately assessing tail movement (e.g., in dogs with snipped tails). In the post-interaction phase (when the owner had put the object down), 36% of the dogs snapped at the stuffed dog while snapping behavior in the other conditions was confined to one dog (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 20.57, p&lt; .001). The aggression in the jealousy condition is particularly impressive given that we only tested dogs whose owners believed that their dogs would not behave aggressively in novel situations.    The next series of analyses examined attention seeking and specifically focused on the behaviors most commonly noted by owners when describing their animals' jealous behaviors [14]. Dogs were significantly more likely to push or touch their owners (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 26.87, p&lt; .001) and the object (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 24.07, p&lt; .001) in the jealousy condition relative to either the jack-o-lantern or book conditions. Results for follow up McNemar nonparametric tests are presented in Figure 1. Of particular interest, dogs specifically tried to get between the owner and the object more often in the jealousy condition (Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 6.53, p&lt; .04). Such behaviors aimed at preventing or breaking up a liaison have been hypothesized to be the primary motivational state that accompanies jealousy and that distinguishes jealousy from other emotions such as anger [1], [19]. Although vocalizations during the experiment were relatively infrequent, whining occurred significantly more in the jealousy condition than in the book condition. Barking did not significantly differ across conditions.    At the suggestion of a reviewer, we summed the behaviors presented in Figure 1 for each condition in order to get a sense of the effect size of the jealousy condition and performed within-subjects ANOVA with partial eta-squared tests. Partial eta-squared for the dog vs. jack-o-lantern conditions was .41 and for dog vs. book was .58.    In the preverbal human infant literature, jealousy is accompanied not only by negative affect but also by heightened interest and attention toward the mother while she is interacting with what appears to be another infant [10][12]. We found similar effects in dogs. Results for within-subject ANOVAs are presented in the text while results for follow up paired t-tests are displayed in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, dogs gazed significantly more at their owners (F(2, 70) = 7.47, p&lt; .001, = .18) and the objects (F(2, 70) = 56.39, p&lt; .001, = .62) in the conditions in which the owner was displaying affection towards an object relative to the control condition of reading aloud. Furthermore, when the object of affection appeared to be a conspecific, dogs looked more at the object relative to when it was a novel item (jack-o-lantern). This pattern is furthered supported by the inversely related measures of disinterest, operationally defined by orienting the body away from the owner and object (Figure 2). Dogs spent significantly more time ignoring the owner and object in the book condition relative to the conditions that involved displays of affection: F(2, 70) = 30.62, p&lt; .001, = .47 for owner; F(2, 70) = 87.27, p&lt; .001, = .71 for object.    Behaviors during the post-task period were similar to those seen during the actual interaction (although less informative given that behavior was merely coded as present/absent). More dogs ignored the object in the jack-o-lantern (94.4%) and book (91.7%) conditions than in the dog condition (52.8%); Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 20.01, p&lt; .001. There was also a significant difference in the number of dogs who observed the object across conditions (72.2% in dog condition; 63.9% in jack-o-lantern condition; and 44.4% in book condition): Cochran's Q, 2 (2) = 6.58, p&lt; .04. There was not a significant difference in the number of dogs who followed their owner after each condition, 2 (2) = 4.67, p = .10.    Was the stuffed dog perceived as real? One might wonder whether the subject dogs believed that the stuffed animal was a real dog. The data discussed previously, particularly the aggressive behaviors aimed at the stuffed animal, would seem to suggest that they did. Perhaps even more compellingly, 86% of the dogs sniffed the anal region of the toy dog during the experiment or post-experiment phases. Having a faux rival dog enabled us to maximize the amount of control we had in the experiment. That jealousy behaviors were seen under these somewhat impoverished social conditions leads us to predict that such behaviors would be even more enhanced in the present of an actual rival dog who responded to the owner's affectionate displays. In the present work any single behavior might not be indicative of jealousy per se. However, the pattern of behaviors, particularly when dogs were confronted with their owners displaying affection to what appeared to be another dog, is similar to the constellation of behaviors seen in humans. These data thus present a strong case that domestic dogs have a form of jealousy.    Individual Differences An anonymous reviewer suggested that our data might reflect individual differences in dog cognition and/or jealousy. One possibility is that only some dogs perceived the stuffed dog as real and that this difference in cognitive ability resulted in jealousy in some dogs but not others. To the reviewer's mind, only those dogs that aggressed against the rival dog can be shown to definitively consider the fake dog stimulus as real. We believe that the fact that the vast majority of the dogs sniffed the anal region of the stuffed dog (including all of the aggressive dogs) suggests that most of the dogs conceptualized the dog as real, but we cannot rule out the reviewer's suggestion. However, even if most dogs perceived the stimulus as real, it is still possible that only some of them reacted with jealousy to it. The reviewer suggested some additional analyses to explore possible individual differences. One question is whether the snapping dogs were the only ones to show additional jealous behaviors. As described below, our data suggest that they were not, although their jealousy might be argued to be more intense in some respects than their nonsnapping peers. In total, 41.7% of dogs snapped during or after their owner interacted with the stuffed dog. We found that these aggressive dogs did display many other jealous behaviors: All of them pushed at the owner and 86.7% pushed at the fake dog during the jealousy interaction. There was also some tendency for these dogs to spend more time (although not significantly so) attending to the owner and the fake dog (and conversely less time ignoring the owner and rival) than nonsnapping dogs. However, not all jealous behaviors were more common in the snapping dogs. Whining was similar across the two types of dogs and while 26.7% of the snapping dogs attempted to get between their owner and the rival dog, 33.3% of the nonaggressive dogs did so. Moreover, many of the nonsnapping dogs also displayed other jealousy indicators. For example, 61.9% pushed at the owner and 57.1% pushed at the stuffed dog. These percents are higher if the dogs that did not sniff the rear end are excluded (who likely did not perceive the stuffed dog as a threat). Thus, these exploratory analyses would argue against the suggestion that only aggressive dogs displayed jealous behaviors, although their jealousy may be viewed as more extreme. These data raise the possibility that dogs, like humans, show individual differences in how jealousy is exhibited, which ranges from attention seeking and restorative behaviors to aggressive acts. The fact some dogs (13.8%) failed to sniff the rear end of the fake dog raises stimulating questions for future studies. Jealous behaviors were infrequent among these animals, suggesting that they were not in an emotional state (e.g., none pushed on the owner or the stuffed dog and only one got between them). One interesting possible avenue for future work is to examine the cognitive abilities that are associated with not believing the stuffed dog is real. It might be that such dogs are less cognitively sophisticated (they do not perceive the toy as representation of a real dog.). However, it is also possible that they are more sophisticated, (i.e., were not fooled into believing that the stuffed dog was genuine, and hence it was not a threat). In sum, it may be that while all dogs have the neurobiological cognitive capacity for jealousy, the current situation may have failed to induce the emotional state in some dogs. Understanding what factors (cognition or social dynamics) contribute to individual differences in dog jealousy would seem a ripe area for future work.

Wall Street is breathing down companies necks to cut costs, and the labor savings in Mexico is too great.    Mr. Trump first announced he was talking to Carrier on Thanksgiving Day via Twitter, which the company quickly confirmed. The discussions have continued this week, and with a tentative deal in hand on Tuesday, transition officials scheduled Mr. Trumps and Mr. Pences visit to Indianapolis.    I didnt think it would be this quick, Mr. Maynard said.    While the standoff loomed large in the lives of its employees in Indiana, for United Technologies the forgone savings is tiny equivalent to about 2 cents per share in earnings.    Every penny counts, but if we step back and Im looking at earnings of $6.60 per share this year, 2 cents is an easy concession if the president-elect listens to some of the companys bigger concerns, said Howard Rubel, a senior equity analyst with Jefferies, an investment banking firm in New York.    When Carrier announced in February that the two Indiana factories would be closing, it did offer benefits to employees facing layoffs, including paying for them to go back to school and retrain for other careers. Even with that, however, once the layoffs were to begin in mid-2017, most of the workers would have had a hard time finding jobs that paid anywhere near the $20 to $25 an hour that veteran line workers earn.    Carrier is best known for its air-conditioners, but it also sells a variety of other heating and cooling equipment for homes and businesses, like the gas furnaces and fan coils for electric furnaces made at the Indianapolis factory. The jobs in Indiana Mr. Trump has referred to are in two separate sites the Carrier plant in Indianapolis, with 1,400 employees, and a United Technologies factory in Huntington, Ind., with 700.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/elizabeth-warren-staff-pay/http://freebeacon.com/issues/elizabeth-warrens-female-staffers-made-71-less-male-staffers-earnings-2016/,mixture," BY: Follow @brentscher        The gender pay gap in Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D., Mass.) office is nearly 10 percent wider than the national average, meaning women in the Massachusetts Democrat's office will have to wait longer than most women across the country to recognize Equal Pay Day.    Equal Pay Day, created two decades ago by the National Committee on Pay Equity, is scheduled by using the Census Bureau annual unadjusted gender pay gap to determine how far into the next year women would have to work to match annual earnings of men. Last year's figures, showing that women earned 79.6 percent of what men earned, put Equal Pay Day on Tuesday April 4, more than three months into the calendar year.    However, women working for Warren were paid just 71 cents for every dollar paid to men during the 2016 fiscal year, according to a Washington Free Beacon analysis.    The median annual earnings for women staffers, $52,750, was more than $20,000 less than the median annual earnings for men, $73,750, according to the analysis of publicly available Senate data.    When calculated using average salaries rather than median, the pay gap expands to just over $26,051, or about 31 percent.    Consistent with previous Free Beacon analyses of Senate salary data, only full-time staffers who were employed for the entire period in question were included in the calculations.    For example, Warren's former chief of staff Mindy Myers and her male replacement Dan Geldon were not included because neither worked the full year.    Among employees employed the entire year, only one woman, Warren's director of scheduling, earned a six-figure salary, at $100,624.88.    Five menWarren's director of oversight and investigations ($156,000), legislative director ($149,458), deputy chief of staff ($119,375), Massachusetts state director ($152,310), and deputy state director ($113,750)earned more than Warren's highest paid woman staffer in 2016.    Many discount attributing gender pay differences to discrimination, arguing that these comparisons fail to take into account several contributing factors, but Warren is not one of them.    Warren said on last year's Equal Pay Day that the American workplace was ""rigged against women"" and called it a ""national day of embarrassment"" for the nation.    ""Today is Equal Pay Day, and by the sound of it, you would think it's some sort of historic holiday commemorating the anniversary of a landmark day that our country guaranteed equal pay for women,"" Warren said. ""But that's not what this is about. Not even close.""    #EqualPayDay isnt a national day of celebration. Its a national day of embarrassment. Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) April 12, 2016    ""The game is rigged against women and families, and it has to stop,"" Warren continued. ""It is 2016, not 1916, and it's long past time to eliminate gender discrimination in the workplace.""    Historically, 1995 was the last year where the national pay gap was comparable to the 2016 gap in Warren's office, according to data collected by the group that founded Equal Pay Day.    Warren is far from the only politician who pays women less than men.    Most notable on the list is failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who paid women less than men first as a senator, then as secretary of state, and as a presidential candidate. Her campaign viewed her tendency to pay women less than men as a campaign vulnerability.    Former President Barack Obama regularly spoke out about the gender pay gap, but women working at the White House were paid less than men.    Also paying women less than men were Democratic Govs. Jon Bel Edwards (La.), who last month held an ""equal pay summit,"" and Andrew Cuomo (N.Y.), who has signed two executive orders this year to eliminate the wage gap.    Warren's office did not respond to inquiries regarding the disparity. ",An analysis determined that Senator Elizabeth Warren pays her female staffers less than their male counterparts.,test

Trump because the fate of this nation depends upon sending him, and not Hillary Clinton, to the White House.    I know Donald Trump, but were not close friends. However, I believe he will begin on Day One undoing the damage done by President Barack Obama. I stand ready to help him at every turn.    Like many, I am deeply concerned about the US Supreme Court. When Trump recently released his list of potential appointees, I grew confident in his resolve to keep our court balanced. Even more important: Clinton will push the court leftward for generations. She must be stopped.    But I draw even more from lessons learned when we founded The Home Depot in 1978 rather than from the contentious GOP primary of 2016. I genuinely believe that if we to started The Home Depot today, we would fail because of the hurdles government, especially the current administration, places in front of small business owners. I never forget The Home Depots small business roots we started as a small business with four stores in Atlanta, Georgia.    I think of the banker who nearly lost his job by taking a risk and giving us a line of credit when we started. He didnt just look at our balance sheet; he believed in our character and determination. Government regulators dont allow this under Dodd-Frank a law Hillary Clinton wants to make far worse.    And going public under Sarbanes-Oxley, a Clinton favorite? Not the company we built, nor thousands of other businesses like ours the nation will never know because they died at birth, strangled by faceless bureaucrats and politicians who erroneously believe that government can do it better.    Yet the risks we took in the 1970s have resulted in millions of jobs not just at The Home Depot, but at our suppliers, our vendors, and even our customers businesses. Investors believed in us, and the government did not stop us.    We could not do this today, for the same reason why so many Americans have dropped out of the workforce, why their wages have been stagnant, why their health care is a mess, and why our economy has stalled. Its Obama/Clinton-style government thats getting in the way.    I have never seen our government as hostile to free enterprise, especially small business, as it is today. It is driving over-regulation, over-taxation, over-litigation, and over-spending. These overs are killing small businesses, which create the majority of new jobs in America.    Politicians like Obama and Clinton, aided by the media and academia, have peddled a dangerous sentiment that government can provide for Americans better than the private sector. Thats not just false, its likely the nexus of Trumps massively popular slogan, Make America Great Again. We saw it first hand.    The vast majority of early Home Depot associates did not have a college education. But they worked hard and were paid with salaries and stock options. Those options made many people wealthy, and fueled our robust growth.    One young man started with us at 17 years of age, bringing carts in from the parking lot. Ultimately, he became a regional president. Imagine Americans vilifying this young man, who became a millionaire and earned every penny of it.    What makes America great? Risk, preparation, hard work, and a young mans willingness to shag carts from a parking lot because he has faith that he and his family can be great.    Donald Trump is right: To inspire more of these men and women, we must make America great again. Record-breaking numbers of Republican primary voters agree. They overwhelmingly want Donald Trump to lead this sea change, and we believe he can. But he needs to stand on our shoulders; he cannot do it alone.    One of the greatest lessons we took away from The Home Depot is to always listen to your customers. Without their input, we surely would have failed. Republican leaders must listen to their customers, too their voters and they have spoken clearly.    As Americans, the choice is abundantly clear: If you want four more years of President Obama, vote for Hillary Clinton; if you want to take the country in a new direction, vote for Donald Trump.    Make no mistake, Republicans who refuse to stand behind their partys nominee are electing Clinton, whether they cast their ballots for her or not. I have a message for the #NeverTrump crowd: Enough already. Donald Trump is our presumptive nominee and it is time to get over wishing it were not so. If you dont, change your social media hashtag to #HillaryGOP.    As a GOP donor who stood steadfastly behind Jeb Bush and who has contributed to candidates for a generation I urge all Republicans to stand up and be counted in support for Donald Trump.

With two suitcases in tow, his parents both doctors left behind a country on the verge of social turmoil. It was 1979, about two years before the countrys authoritarian communist government declared martial law.    Niec received a temporary green card and, in 1989, became a lawful permanent resident. He grew up in Michigan, went to medical school, became a doctor, and raised a daughter and stepdaughter.    Niec, now 43, never fathomed that his legal status in the United States would become an issue. With a renewed green card, and nearly 40 years in the country, his Polish nationality was an afterthought for Niec, his sister told The Washington Post. He doesnt even speak Polish.    But on Tuesday morning, immigration authorities arrested Niec at his home, just after he had sent his 12-year-old stepdaughter off to school. Niec, a physician specializing in internal medicine at Bronson Healthcare Group in Kalamazoo, Mich., has been detained in a county jail ever since, awaiting a bond hearing and possible deportation.    Its shocking, said his sister Iwona Niec Villaire, a corporate lawyer. No one can really understand what happened here.    According to his notice to appear from the Department of Homeland Security, Niecs detention stems from two misdemeanor convictions from 26 years ago. In January 1992, Niec was convicted of malicious destruction of property under $100. In April of that year, he was convicted of receiving and concealing stolen property over $100 and a financial transaction device.    Because Niec was convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude, stemming from two separate incidents, he is subject to removal, immigration authorities wrote in the notice to appear, citing the Immigration and Nationality Act.    Both of the offenses took place when he was a teenager. He associated himself with some bad people his sister said. The first of the incidents involved an altercation with a driver after a car crash, Niecs sister said. He was one of multiple teenagers in the car at the time.    The second of those convictions was eventually expunged from his criminal record, his sister said, as part of a guilty plea through Michigans Holmes Youthful Trainee Act, a program intended to help young offenders avoid the stigma of a criminal conviction. But even though the crime was scrubbed off his public record, it can still be used against him for removal from the country, his sister said.    ICE has not responded to requests for information from The Washington Post and declined to comment to WOOD-TV. Since Thursday, a spokesman for the ICE Detroit Field Office has not responded to requests for information from MLive, except to say he was looking into the case.    According to Kalamazoo County court records cited by MLive, Niec also pleaded guilty in 2008 to operating impaired by liquor. After he completed probation, the conviction was set aside, the plea withdrawn and the case dismissed. He was also charged with domestic violence in 2013 and a jury found him not guilty after a trial, MLive reported.    Niecs record has multiple blemishes. But his wife insists that he is not a risk to the public. When he renewed his permanent green card a few years ago, he was given a false sense of security, that it would be enough, she said.    Over the decades, tens of thousands of legal residents have been deported for relatively minor offenses. But under previous administrations, immigration authorities have often let low-level offenders off the hook, prioritizing the deportations of violent criminals. A memo from the Obama administration in 2011 directed immigration officials to look at a number of factors, such as familial relationships with U.S. citizens, criminal history, education and contributions to the community, in deciding whether arrests and prosecution are warranted, as The Posts Kristine Phillips reported.    But the Trump administration has issued sweeping new guidelines expanding the range of immigrants that count as high priority for deportation, including low-level offenders, and those with no criminal record regardless of how long they have lived in the country. Now, immigrants feel the threat of deportation more than ever, advocates say, whether they are residing here legally or not.    Villaire, the doctors sister, said she previously felt as though green-card holders were like anybody else. She was a green-card holder until she successfully applied for citizenship during law school, she said.    You couldnt vote, but that was really the only difference, she said. Thats not the case anymore. . . . Having that status is no longer enough.    Lucasz Niec had been considering applying for citizenship, particularly after his July 2016 marriage to his current wife, Rachelle Burkart-Niec, who is an American citizen, she told The Post. But with both of their demanding schedules, they had not gotten around to it yet, she said.    Lucasz Niec has been a doctor for more than a decade. He treats patients at three different Bronson hospitals, and is responsible for scheduling all physicians in his group, covering about five hospitals in the area, his wife said. He was picked up by immigration officials on his first day off after working a week straight, including several double shifts.    His wife was working her shift as a charge nurse at a Bronson hospital Tuesday morning when she received the phone call from her husband, saying he had been arrested by immigration officers. She was so taken aback that she thought he was pulling a prank on her, she said.    Now, after nearly a week in jail, Lucasz Niec has yet to see a judge, and his family says he has received no information from immigration authorities since the day of his arrest.    He is needed in the hospital, his wife said. Hospitals in the area are packed full, she said, in part because of the widespread influenza. The Kalamazoo area has seen an increase in flu cases in recent weeks, in numbers well above the four-year average, according to the Kalamazoo County Health and Community Services Department.    A number of his hospital colleagues have written letters to an immigration judge, rallying support for Niec, MLive reported.    The consensus about his character is overwhelming with no single complaint I have ever heard from anyone over 10 years, Kwsai Al-Rahhal, M.D. wrote, according to MLive. He is loving, caring and respectful.    Another colleague, Jose Angelo L. De Leon, M.D., wrote about how Niec often stepped up to take on extra hours due to staff shortages.    I cannot say enough about his work ethic and his service to our community, De Leon wrote.    Villaire said she is hiring a lawyer for her brother, and is hoping Michigans governor considers pardoning his misdemeanor offenses. She is also seeking other avenues by digging through her familys archives.    For example, Villaire knows her mother became a naturalized citizen, but she is not sure when. If she was granted citizenship before Lucasz Niec turned 18, he may already be a citizen by default, Villaire said. But both their mother and father are now deceased, and some crucial documents are missing in the archives they left behind with their children.    Deporting Lucasz Niec would mean sending him to a country and culture completely foreign to him, his sister said. He has been back to Poland once, as a teenager, she said. He has maintained no relationships with family or friends there and has never felt much of a connection to his Polish heritage, his sister said, adding that her brother is as American as anyone gets.    He cant be deported, his wife said. He cant speak Polish. He wouldnt know where to go. He would be lost.

Steve King (R-Iowa) retweeted a British neo-Nazi on Tuesday, the latest in a series of incidents in which the congressman has parroted or promoted the views of unabashed white supremacists and other bigots. Europe is waking up... Will America... in time? King tweeted, linking to an anti-immigrant tweet from political activist Mark Collett. Collett is one of Britains most high-profile white supremacists. He has expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and has called himself a Nazi sympathizer. Kings office did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday as to whether he condones the views of neo-Nazis, whether hes concerned his views align with those of neo-Nazis or whether a U.S. congressman should be amplifying a neo-Nazi on Twitter. Kings office also did not respond when asked if the congressman considers himself a white nationalist. The tweet, posted early Tuesday morning, hasnt been deleted.    Twitter screenshot    No mainstream politician in their right mind should be retweeting Mark Collett, said Nick Ryan, director of communications at the British-based anti-racism advocacy group Hope Not Hate. Hes a neo-Nazi who used to be the youth leader of the thuggish far-right British National Party here in the U.K., which has had ties to Holocaust denial, rampant anti-Semitism, helped spawn one of Europes most infamous neo-Nazi gangs, Combat 18, and which once included among its number David Copeland, a bomber who targeted Londons minority communities with a series of nail bombs in 1999, killing three, including a pregnant woman, and wounding scores of others, Ryan said. Collett was the subject of a 2002 Channel 4 documentary in the United Kingdom called Young, Nazi and Proud, in which he states that AIDS is a friendly disease because blacks, drug users and gays have it. The Jews have been thrown out of every country, including England, he says in the documentary. Lets face it, when it happens that many times its not just persecution: theres no smoke without fire. More recently, as documented on the blog Angry White Men, Collett has been a frequent guest on white nationalist or alt-right podcasts. Just last month, he co-hosted an episode of This Week on the Alt-Right. The episodes special guest was American white supremacist and former KKK leader David Duke, whom Collett praised. If he has any sense, Steve King should rapidly hit the undo button [on Twitter], Ryan, the Hope Not Hate spokesperson, said of Kings tweet Tuesday. But King has a long history of making racist statements and signaling his support for white nationalism.    Bill Clark via Getty Images Rep.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lionesses-grow-manes/http://www.nzg.ac.za/newsletter/issues/29/06.php,ftrue," The intriguing case of Emma the lioness Male lions are well known for their long mane hair that covers the side of their head and neck, often extending onto their chests and ventral abdomen. Male lions start developing a mane when they reach puberty. This is mainly due to rising levels of the hormone testosterone. Male lions that are castrated, will lose their mane hair because the testes are the main site of testosterone production. Similar to castrated males, female lions do not normally produce sufficient testosterone to produce any significant mane hair. Emma grows a mane In April 2011, Emma, a 13-year-old lioness at the National Zoo starting growing a mane of similar length to that of a sub-adult male. Initially we suspected that she may have some abnormalities of her reproductive tract, so an abdominal ultrasound evaluation was performed at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital. However, all her reproductive organs appeared to be normal. Blood levels of various sex hormones were evaluated and as suspected, she had elevated levels of testosterone. We decided to remove her ovaries as these where most likely the cause of her elevated testosterone. This was done laparoscopically by Dr Marthinus Hartman at Onderstepoort in September 2011. Skin biopsy samples were sent to Stellenbosch University for chromosome analysis to see if Emma had some sort of sex chromosome abnormality, but the results showed that she had normal female XX chromosomes. The removed ovaries were evaluated by the NZG's own pathologist, Dr Emily Lane. Surprisingly, the ""ovaries"" that were removed, only contained cells normally seen in the testicles of males. This was obviously where the testosterone was being produced. Did Emma's ovaries change into testes? What makes this case remarkable, is that theoo records show that Emma gave birth to four cubs in 2000. In order to give birth to cubs, she must have had normal ovaries at that time. Genetic tests done on Emma and her cubs, so far also seem to confirm that she is the mother of those lions. Further genetic tests are currently being done on samples from the only other female that was present in theoo at the time to ensure that no mistake was made in identifying the mother of the cubs. If Emma proves to be the mother, then this case seems to indicate that Emma's ovaries changed into testes. This is something that is virtually unheard of in mammals. Other cases Other cases have been documented in the popular literature of lionesses that have developed mane hair. These reports have come from bothoo and free-ranging animals, but so far the abnormality has not been described in the scientific literature. Currently Dr Adrian Tordiffe and other researchers are investigating individual cases reported in the Kruger National Park and in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. After her ovaries were removed, Emma gradually lost her mane hair and returned to her normal female good looks. A health evaluation conducted only a few days ago revealed that even at 15 and a half years of age, she is in excellent health.

Click here to read about media coverage and impact of this open letter.    Dear Mr. Trump:    At the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, students are taught to represent the highest levels of respect and integrity. We are taught to embrace humility and diversity. We can understand why, in seeking Americas highest office, you have used your degree from Wharton to promote and lend legitimacy to your candidacy.    As a candidate for President, and now as the presumptive GOP nominee, you have been afforded a transformative opportunity to be a leader on national and international stages and to make the Wharton community even prouder of our school and values.    However, we have been deeply disappointed in your candidacy.    We, proud students, alumni, and faculty of Wharton, are outraged that an affiliation with our school is being used to legitimize prejudice and intolerance. Although we do not aim to make any political endorsements with this letter, we do express our unequivocal stance against the xenophobia, sexism, racism, and other forms of bigotry that you have actively and implicitly endorsed in your campaign.    The Wharton community is a diverse community. We are immigrants and children of immigrants, people of color, Muslims, Jews, women, people living with or caring for those with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ community. In other words, we represent the groups that you have repeatedly denigrated, as well as their steadfast friends, family, and allies.    We recognize that we are fortunate to be educated at Wharton, and we are committed to using our opportunity to make America and the world a better place for everyone.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/point-ocean-closest-human-astronaut/http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20161004-the-place-furthest-from-land-is-known-as-point-nemo,ftrue," Where do you go to get away from it all? When the stress of everyday life pushes you to search for the most remote point on Earth, you might be surprised to learn there are actually a few to choose from.    But if you have decent sea legs, nothing beats the furthest point from land, also known as the ""oceanic pole of inaccessibility"".    Since its official title is a bit of a mouthful, it has been nicknamed Point Nemo, after author Jules Verne's famous seafaring anti-hero Captain Nemo. The name means ""no-one"" in Latin, which is fitting for a place so rarely visited by people.    Point Nemo is located over 1,000 miles (1,600km) equidistantly from the coasts of three far-flung islands. Ducie Island (one of the Pitcairn islands) is to the north, Motu Nui (of the Easter Island chain) is to the north-east and Maher Island (off the coast of Antarctica) is to the south.    It is a rather peculiar place.    Experts had long discussed the geographical conundrum of finding the middle of the ocean, but it took modern technology to provide a full solution. The oceanic pole of inaccessibility was officially discovered in 1992 by survey engineer Hrvoje Lukatela.    Instead of launching an expedition, Lukatela stayed on dry land and calculated the point's location using specialist computer software. Rather than simply putting a pin in a flat projection of the Earth, the software incorporated the planet's ellipsoid shape for maximum accuracy.    It seems unlikely that the point will move significantly within the foreseeable future.    ""The location of three equilateral points is quite unique, and there are no other points on the Earth's surface that could conceivably replace any one of those,"" says Lukatela. It is possible that better measurements, or coastal erosion, would shift the location of Point Nemo, ""but only in the order of metres"".    Point Nemo is so far from land, the nearest humans are often astronauts. The International Space Station orbits the Earth at a maximum of 258 miles (416km). Meanwhile the nearest inhabited landmass to Point Nemo is over 1,670 miles (2,700km) away.    In fact the whole region around Point Nemo is well known to space agencies.    The area is officially known to space agencies as the ""South Pacific Ocean Uninhabited Area"". In particular, the Russian, European and Japanese space agencies have long used it as a dumping ground, because it is the point on the planet with the fewest human inhabitants and the quietest shipping routes.    Over a hundred decommissioned spacecraft are thought to now occupy this ""spacecraft cemetery"", from satellites and cargo ships to the defunct space station Mir.    In 1997, oceanographers recorded a mysterious noise less than 1,240 miles (2,000km) east of Point Nemo    Rather than single monuments to the history of space travel, the remains are spread across the ocean floor in bits, says space archaeologist Alice Gorman of Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia.    ""Spacecraft do not survive atmospheric re-entry whole,"" says Gorman. ""Most of them burn up in the fierce heat. The most common components to survive are fuel tanks and pressure vehicles, which are part of the fuel system. These are generally made of titanium alloys or stainless steel, often encased in complex carbon fibres, which are resistant to high temperatures.""    While smaller fragments burn up in the atmosphere, leaving nothing but an impressive light show, Gorman says the larger parts of the 143-tonne Mir were reputed to have washed up on Fijian beaches, while the rest sank to the ocean depths.    ""Like shipwrecks, they create habitats that will be colonised by anything and everything that lives at that depth,"" says Gorman. ""Unless there is residual fuel that leaks out, there should not be a hazard to aquatic life.""    Rumours have long swirled about what might live at Point Nemo.    Despite writing 66 years before its discovery, science fiction author HP Lovecraft chose a site eerily close to the oceanic pole of inaccessibility for R'lyeh, the home of his legendary tentacle-faced creature Cthulhu.    D'Hondt describes it as ""the least biologically active region of the world ocean""    In 1997, oceanographers recorded a mysterious noise less than 1,240 miles (2,000km) east of Point Nemo. This led to a great deal of excitement, and a fair bit of trepidation. The sound, dubbed ""the Bloop"", was louder than even a blue whale leading to speculation that it was made by some unknown sea monster.    However, the Bloop has since been confirmed to be the sound of ice by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. When large icebergs crack and fracture, they generate powerful, ultra-low-frequency sounds. Subsequent recordings of known icequakes have shared similarities with the Bloop.    So if Point Nemo is not really home to an octopus-man-dragon, what exactly does live there? According to oceanographer Steven D'Hondt of the University of Rhode Island in Narragansett, possibly not much.    This is because the oceanic point of inaccessibility sits within the South Pacific Gyre. This is a massive rotating ocean current: bound east and west by the continents of South America and Australia, north by the equator, and south by the strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current.    It is an extreme environment, but bacteria thrive here    The waters within the gyre are stable, with a surface temperature of 5.8C (42F) at Point Nemo according to data from NASA satellites. The rotating current blocks cooler, nutrient-rich water from coming in.    What's more, because the region is so isolated from land masses, the wind does not carry much organic matter.    As a result, there is little to feed anything. With no material falling from above as ""marine snow"", the seafloor is also lifeless. D'Hondt describes it as ""the least biologically active region of the world ocean.""    Still, there are a few exceptional points where unique creatures can survive.    Point Nemo is near the southern end of the East Pacific Rise, a submarine line of volcanic activity that stretches up to the Gulf of California. It marks the boundary of the Pacific and Nazca tectonic plates, which are gradually moving apart. Magma wells up in the gap between the plates, creating hydrothermal vents that blast out hot water and minerals.    On a calm day, the sea surface in the heart of the South Pacific Gyre is simply beautiful    It is an extreme environment, but bacteria thrive here, gaining their energy from chemicals released by the eruptions. In turn, the bacteria sustain larger creatures. These include the ""yeti crab"", which was first observed in 2005 and named for its hairy appearance.    There is still much to be discovered in these depths, but its remoteness makes Point Nemo an expensive and challenging destination for research. Apart from the occasional round-the-world yacht race, there are hardly any visitors. That means it is unlikely to pop up on your social media, so you have to use your imagination to picture it.    ""On a calm day, the sea surface in the heart of the South Pacific Gyre is simply beautiful clear cornflower blue, with a violet tone because it contains so little particulate matter and so little living material,"" says D'Hondt.    Or it would be, if it were not for littering.    When the virtual band Gorillaz released their 2010 album Plastic Beach, they created a fictional backstory: supposedly the music had been recorded at a recording studio built on marine debris at Point Nemo.    HP Lovecraft chose a site eerily close to the oceanic pole of inaccessibility for R'lyeh, the home of his legendary tentacle-faced creature Cthulhu    This is not as entirely far-fetched as it might sound. A study published in 2013 confirmed that there is a garbage patch within the South Pacific Gyre. The biggest accumulation of waste was at the centre, around 1,550 miles (2,500km) north-east of Point Nemo.    The garbage is mainly plastic waste like polystyrene, film, fishing line, fragments and pellets washed from ships and coastlines. The rotating current traps the trash, breaking it down into tiny pieces. Biologists believe the rubbish could could throw the ecosystem out of balance by helping some species proliferate while others suffer.    Even in the most remote spot on the planet, it seems there is no escaping humanity's wasteful habits.

The request applies to priests in Brazil, and is on the agenda for an upcoming synod (church council) in the Amazon region.    The controversial move would address the critical shortage of men joining the priesthood but is likely to drive divisions through the church by enraging conservative factions.    A small number of married Roman Catholic priests already exist, including previously married Anglican vicars who have joined the church.    A request to lift the ban on marriage was made by Brazilian bishop Cardinal Claudio Hummes, who reportedly asked the Pope to consider viri probati, meaning married of great faith, as priests.

Fr OKane cited Brazilian liberation theologian Leonardo Boff, who said: The Brazilian bishops, especially the popes own personal friend Cardinal Claudio Hummes, have expressly requested Pope Francis to enable married priest in Brazil to return to pastoral ministry.

St Peters Square in Rome (Niall Carson/PA Wire) More    Earlier this year the Pope told Die Zeit newspaper: We must consider if viri probati is a possibility. Then we must determine what tasks they can perform, for example, in remote communities.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/prescott-college-mandatory-immigrant-fee/https://t.co/Ko0aWiJgAv,mixture," Students will be required to pay a $30 fee which goes to the Freedom Education Fund at Prescott College for undocumented students.    Prescott, Arizona Prescott College will implement a mandatory $30 student fee for all on-campus students that will go towards the Freedom Education Fund, a scholarship for undocumented students, starting in the 2016-2017 academic year. Prescott College is proud to announce the availability of this scholarship to one undocumented student as part of National Institutions Coming Out Day in support of undocumented students, an annual event hosted by United We Dream.    This is the first time a four-year college in Arizona has implemented such a fee, and only the second in the country to do so. The fee was a student led initiative with collaboration between undergraduate and Social Justice and Human Rights Master of Arts students, community members, and faculty members.    Prescott College President John Flicker says, I am proud that our students take on the role of scholar activists. The passion around this issue really motivated our part to make up the difference between what the fee will provide for and the full cost to attend one of our programs. Were committed to broaden access to higher education for a diverse group of students and mobilize our resources towards social justice.    The fee will support one student this coming academic year, but the College hopes to raise additional funds to support more full tuition scholarships for additional undocumented students, who are not eligible to receive federal financial aid.    Within the current political landscape of Arizona it is critical that Prescott College shows our commitment to education as a human right, says Miriel Manning, founder of the Freedom Education Fund and student in the Social Justice and Human Rights Master of Arts program. We were inspired by courageous leadership and organizing of undocumented leaders across the country.    At Prescott College, the application process and financial aid are open to all students, including both undocumented and DACA-status students. Students interested in applying for the Freedom Education Fund scholarship should contact Admissions at (928) 350-2100 or Financial Aid at (928) 350-1111.    Anyone interested in building the Freedom Education Fund can donate at freedom.education.fund.kintera.org, or contact Miriel Manning at _EMAIL_ to get involved.    Frequently Asked Questions    Who is eligible for this scholarship? What qualifies as undocumented?    The recipients will be undocumented, full-time or part-time undergraduate or graduate students at Prescott College that demonstrate financial need. A qualified applicant for the Fund must not be a legal permanent resident and not possess a green card, visa, or other legal documentation. Undocumented status also includes individuals who have been granted conditional resident status or a deferred removal action under federal law and individuals that were born outside of the United States but have lived in this country for a significant portion of their lives.    Undocumented students cannot receive federal financial aid.    Undocumented students are not eligible for federal or state loans.    Many state universities charge undocumented students out-of-state tuition even if they have been living in the state long enough to have residency. Many other universities charge them international student tuition which is much more expensive than in-state.    Until 2012, when DACA passed, no undocumented students could legally work which highly limited their ability to put themselves through school. Now some undocumented students have work permits through DACA, but not all.    What is DACA?    DACA stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.    On June 15, 2012, President Obama signed a memo calling for deferred action for certain undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children and have pursued education or military service. Eligible undocumented students who have a valid I-766 and can demonstrate residency in Arizona, are considered for in-state tuition status at Pima Community College. (Scholarships A-Z definition)    Is it illegal to give aid to undocumented students?    Undocumented students are not expressly prohibited by law from admission to state colleges and universities. No federal statutes require disclosure and proof of immigration status and citizenship for students to enter higher education.    How many undocumented students graduate from high school every year?    Only 5-10% of the estimated 65,000 undocumented high school graduates who have been in the U.S at least 5 years go on to attend higher education.    Why is there a Monarch butterfly in the logo?    The Monarch butterfly, or mariposa in Spanish, is a symbol used throughout the Migrant Justice movement by artists and activists alike. The Monarch butterfly represents the resiliency and strength of a warrior and the right to move freely across political borders.    Monarch Butterflies are known for their mass migration of 3,000 miles over North America through multiple generations. We chose this as a symbol of how the Freedom Education Fund is part of a national movement for justice and freedom.    Why Freedom Education Fund?    The struggle for access education for undocumented students is part of many larger social movements of our time. Real freedom means collective liberation- that no one of us is free unless all of us are free. We invoke freedom not as a declaration that this scholarship is freedom, but that it is a step towards a larger vision for justice; education should be free and accessible for all.    Are there other schools that have scholarships specifically for undocumented students?    Yes! There are over 45 other public, private colleges, and universities that offer institutional and endowed scholarships specifically to undocumented students. Additionally, 18 states now offer in-state tuition to students who are undocumented.    I do believe in education for all and I know this scholarship fund will make higher education a possibility for someone that may have thought that they could never get one, or that it was very difficult or nearly impossible to do it. With the help of other scholarships, I was able to make my own college graduation a reality, so I hope that this college fund will be able to do the same for others.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/president-obama-bans-the-words-negro-and-oriental/https://t.co/BmEKfmAQyT,mfalse," In 1790, the U.S. Census counted people by lumping them into one of three categories slaves, free white females and males, or all other free persons.    By 1980, the categories had gone through nearly 20 deviations. People could identify as one of 15 possibilities, including now-derogatory words such as Negro. These classifications might shed some light on why some federal laws from that time contain outdated verbiage thats now being addressed.    After it was unanimously passed with 380 votes, President Barack Obama signed H.R. 4238 on Friday, which amends two federal acts from the 70s that define minorities with terms that are now insensitive or outdated.    The Department of Energy Act has for decades described minorities as, a Negro, Puerto Rican, American Indian, Eskimo, Oriental, or Aleut or is a Spanish speaking individual of Spanish descent.    The new bill changes the language to, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, a Pacific Islander, African American, Hispanic, Puerto Rican, Native American, or an Alaska Native. Theres also similar language in the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act.    The bill was sponsored by Rep. Grace Meng, D-NY, with 74 Democratic co-sponsors and two Republican ones, who focused on the word Oriental.    [Oriental] is an insulting term that needed to be removed from the books, and I am extremely pleased that my legislation to do that is now the law of the land, Meng said in a statement.    The U.S. Census never used the word Oriental, which became associated in the U.S. with exoticism and Asian-American stereotypes in the 20th century. But it dropped Negro from identities in 2013, after people during the 2010 count said they were offended by it.    The director at the time said 56,000 people during research in the 1990s written under other race that they identified as Negro. So the census had continued to include the word in its 2000 count, and also in 2010, but by then people were raising concerns.    I apologize to them. I am confident that the intent of my colleagues in using the same wording as Census 2000 was to make sure as many people as possible saw words that matched their self-identities. Full inclusiveness was the goal, Robert Groves, former director of the U.S. Census Bureau, wrote. The race question has often changed over the decades, as the country has changed and racial terms have evolved. ","President Obama made the words ""negro"" and ""oriental"" illegal.",test

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/school-shooting-military-deaths/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/18/2018-has-been-deadlier-for-schoolchildren-than-service-members/,mixture," This article has been corrected.    The school shooting near Houston on Friday bolstered a stunning statistic: More people have been killed at schools this year than have been killed while deployed as members of the military.    Data for military casualties are difficult to ascertain. An original version of this article tallied solely reports of casualties released by the Department of Defense, which indicated that 13 members of the military had been killed while deployed, compared to 27 schoolchildren whod died in five shooting incidents this year involving fatalities.    Put another way: Twice as many students have been killed in school shootings as have members of the military who were on deployment. An additional four adults were killed in school shootings in 2018 but an additional 29 members of the military have died in training accidents.    After our original article ran, Jared Keller, a senior editor at the site Task &amp; Purpose, noted that the Department of Defense releases offered an incomplete picture of service member fatalities. Separate data compiled by the Navy, including the Marines, adds additional casualties to the total. In May, an Air National Guard plane crashed in Georgia killing another nine an incident not included in the Department of Defenses reports.    The DoD doesnt always present a clear picture of accidental mishap-related deaths due to worries about operational security, hence the trouble with [Public Affairs Office] releases, Keller wrote in an email. Back in March 2017, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis even cautioned public affairs officials across the military to be cautious about publicly telegraphing readiness shortfalls because communicating that we are broken or not ready to fight invites miscalculation, as his spokesman put it at the time.    On Monday, researcher Zachary Austin sent a more complete set of data about military casualties. Having realized that the Defense Department numbers were incomplete, he began tracking military fatalities separately, tallying 42 this year including casualties in combat, while deployed and during training exercises. That Air National Guard crash, for example, was during a training exercise.    Comparing all fatalities in school shootings with all military deaths, the latter is higher, contrary to the original headline of this article. In both cases, those totals have been boosted by mass casualty events. In the case of the military, 20 of the fatalities occurred in just three aircraft crashes. In the case of schoolchildren, most of the deaths were in Santa Fe, Tex., last week and the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. in February.    Austin explained in an email why he started tracking this data.    Last year I helped with research that showed more American troops had died from peacetime causes than wartime incidents since 2014, he wrote. Theres no centralized public database like the DCAS (Defense Casualty Analysis System) for training fatalities, and it was often maddening to track down accurate historical data. So I decided that in 2018, I would follow along day-by-day and identify every American service member killed in uniform throughout the year. Whether in a combatone or not, they all died for their country.    What the Defense Department reports is those casualties that dont occur during training incidents.    Being a member of the military is still far more dangerous than being a student, of course. There are more than 50 million students in public elementary and high schools and only about 1.3 million members of the armed forces. So far in 2018, a member of the military, deployed or in training, has been more than 50 times as likely to be killed as someone is to die in a school shooting.    That said, 2018 is abnormal. Comparing shootings tallied by The Post with Defense-Department-reported casualties in 2017 that is to say, non-training deaths at no point were the number of military fatalities higher than the number of people killed in school shootings.    2018 has been more deadly than 2017 for both groups. In fact, 2018 is shaping up to be unusually deadly at schools. Comparing the number of deaths and the number of shooting incidents this year directly with those through May 18 of 2017, that difference is stark.    The number of deaths and school shooting incidents through May 18 are each higher this year than at any point since 2000. There have been three times as many deaths in school shootings so far this year than in the second-most deadly year through May 18, 2005.    In fact, there were 36 fatalities in school shootings in total through May 18 of each year from 2000 to 2017 only slightly more than there have been in 2018 alone.    Without the shootings in Florida and Texas, the figure is substantially lower. In 2000 through 2017, there were an average of two deaths in five or six school shootings through this point in each year. Without Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Santa Fe, the totals in 2018 would be four deaths in 14 shooting incidents.    With them, it is 31 deaths in 16 incidents. ","So far in 2018, the number of U.S. students killed in school shootings is greater than the number of U.S. military personnel who have been killed on active duty.",test

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/secret-service-broke-trump/http://archive.is/BwTDS,mfalse," The Secret Service, already stretched thin trying to provide security for President Trumps large family, has now found itself unable to pay hundreds of agents on the commander-in-chiefs protective detail, according to a report Monday.    Secret Service Director Randolph Tex Alles said more than 1,000 agents have already reached the federally mandated salary caps and overtime allowances for the entire year, USA Today reported    The president has a large family, and our responsibility is required in law, Alles told the newspaper. I cant change that. I have no flexibility.    He said 42 people under Trump require protection, including 18 members of his family. Only 31 people required security teams during the Obama administration.    In the first seven months of the Trump administration, agents assigned to the president traveled with him nearly every weekend to one of his properties in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia.    They also accompanied Trumps family members who have taken business trips and vacations in the US and abroad, Alles said.    The compensation has become such a critical concern that Alles said he has begun discussions with lawmakers about raising the salary and overtime cap for agents to $187,000 from $160,000 at least for Trumps first term.    Even with that bump, Alles said about 130 veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours theyve already logged, the newspaper reported.    Since the January inauguration, Trump has traveled to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, seven times, to his golf resort in Bedminster, NJ, five times and to Trump Tower once, the report said.

Borra and Eric Trottier This graph shows the number of detected signals by Spectral Type of star. Credit: Ermanno F. Borra and Eric Trottier We all want there to be aliens. Green ones, pink ones, brown ones, Greys. Or maybe Vulcans, Klingons, even a being of pure energy. Any type will do.    That's why whenever a mysterious signal or energetic fluctuation arrives from somewhere in the cosmos and hits one of our many telescopes, headlines erupt across the media: ""Have We Finally Detected An Alien Signal?"" or ""Have Astronomers Discovered An Alien Megastructure?"" But science-minded people know that we're probably getting ahead of ourselves.    Skepticism still rules the day when it comes to these headlines, and the events that spawn them. That's the way it should be, because we've always found a more prosaic reason for whatever signal from space we're talking about. But, being skeptical is a balancing act; it doesn't mean being dismissive.    What we're talking about here is a new study from E.F. Borra and E. Trottier, two astronomers at Laval University in Canada. Their study, titled ""Discovery of peculiar periodic spectral modulations in a small fraction of solar type stars"" was just published at arXiv.org. ArXiv.org is a pre-print website, so the paper itself hasn't been peer reviewed yet. But it is generating interest.    The two astronomers used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and analyzed the spectra of 2.5 million stars. Of all those stars, they found 234 stars that are producing a puzzling signal. That's only a tiny percentage. And, they say, these signals ""have exactly the shape of an ETI signal"" that was predicted in a previous study by Borra.    This graph shows the number of detected signals by Spectral Type of star. Credit: Ermanno F. Borra and Eric Trottier    Prediction is a key part of the scientific method. If you develop a theory, your theory looks better and better the more you can use it to correctly predict some future events based on it. Look how many times Einstein's predictions based on Relativity have been proven correct.    The 234 stars in Borra and Trottier's study aren't random. They're ""overwhelmingly in the F2 to K1 spectral range"" according to the abstract. That's significant because this is a small range centred around the spectrum of our own Sun. And our own Sun is the only one we know of that has an intelligent species living near it. If ours does, maybe others do too?    The authors acknowledge five potential causes of their findings: instrumental and data reduction effects, rotational transitions in molecules, the Fourier transform of spectral lines, rapid pulsations, and finally the ETI signal predicted by Borra (2012). They dismiss molecules or pulsations as causes, and they deem it highly unlikely that the signals are caused by the Fourier analysis itself. This leaves two possible sources for the detected signals. Either they're a result of the Sloan instrument itself and the data reduction, or they are in fact a signal from extra-terrestrial intelligences.    The detected signals are pulses of light separated by a constant time interval. These types of signals were predicted by Borra in his 2012 paper, and they are what he and Trottier set out to find in the Sloan data. It may be a bit of a red flag when scientist's find the very thing they predicted they would find. But Trottier and Borra are circumspect about their own results.    As the authors say in their paper, ""Although unlikely, there is also a possibility that the signals are due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars."" It may be unlikely, but lots of discoveries seem unlikely at first. Maybe there is a tiny subset of stars with chemical peculiarities that make them act in this way.

Borra and Eric Trottier    To sum it all up, the two astronomers have found a tiny number of stars, very similar to our own Sun, that seem to be the source of pulsed signals. These signals are the same as predicted if a technological society was using powerful lasers to communicate with distant stars.    We all want there to be aliens, and maybe the first sign of them will be pulsed light signals from stars like our own sun. But it's all still very preliminary, and as the authors acknowledge, ""at this stage, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed with further work.""    That further work is already being planned by the Breakthrough Listen Initiative, a project that searches for intelligent life in the cosmos. They plan to use the Automated Planet Finder telescope at the Lick Observatory to further observe some of Borra's 234 stars.    The Breakthrough team don't seem that excited about Borra's findings. They've already poured cold water on it, trotting out the old axiom that ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" in a statement on Borra's paper. They also give Borra's findings a score of 0 to 1 on the Rio Scale. The Rio Scale is something used by the international SETI community to rank detections of phenomena that could indicate advanced life beyond Earth. A rating of 0 to 1 means its insignificant.

Kenn    Animal testing for cosmetics is a hot topic in the beauty industry, with most consumers and many companies deciding to avoid products made with animal testing. After more than two decades following a no testing on animals policy, cosmetics giants Avon, Mary Kay, and Estee Lauder have resumed the practice without letting consumers know. In the late 1980s, PETAs Avon Killing campaign eventually led to the company banning animal testing for their products, with Mary Kay and Este Lauder following suit.    According to a press release from Rush PR, the news was broken after animal rights organization PETA removed the companies from their cruelty-free list after discovering that they had returned to using testing on animals for their products. The three companies began the tests again in order to satisfy regulations from the Chinese government so they could sell their products in China. However, PETA contends that there are alternative testing methods that are just as effective and widely used in the US.    Kathy Guillermo, the Vice President of PETAs Laboratory Investigations was saddened by the move: Avon, Este Lauder, and Mary Kay have regressed a generation: Their products are once again being dripped into rabbits eyes and smeared onto animals abraded skin. Shes urging customers to choose cruelty-free products instead.    Avon spokeswoman Reese Witherspoon may be upset to learn about the new animal testing as well. Late last year she was dismayed to learn a bag she was spotted with was made from real python skin and agreed to throw it away. But perhaps she can use her star power to influence Avon to go back to their animal-friendly ways.

The protest, based on a campaign started by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and organized by the Princeton Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), was designed to raise awareness of animals suffering as part of the fashion fur industry. The protest focused on Ugg boots, which are made from sheepskin and are popular among college-age women.    In addition to Uggs, which are openly noted as derived from animals, fur marked as fake may not actually be, PAWS vice president Alex Barnard 09 explained, adding that clothing imported from China is often unregulated, and recent studies indicate that cat and dog fur may be mislabeled as faux fur.    PAWS hopes to address these issues and change peoples perceptions of fashion through the protest.    We want people to realize that fur, whether it is fake or real, is just ugly, and theres no reason to wear it at all, PAWS president Jenny Palmer 09 said.    Princeton is an ideal place for the protest because of furs association with social status, Barnard said. There is a lot of wealth here, he explained. There are people who wear animal products here because they can afford them.    While PAWS members see demonstrations such as last Fridays as pivotal to awakening activism on campus, some students see the protests as unnecessarily graphic.    Aly Lopez-Aguiar 09 noted that while she agrees with PAWS mission to decrease the use of fur in fashion, the use of fake blood was excessive, she said. If somebody sees something that graphic, theyre going to be turned off of the issue itself, she explained.    Palmer, however, defended the use of provocative images.    Theres always a risk [of offending people], she said. Sometimes theres a lot of apathy; we need to have these shocking images to force people to recognize that the clothes they choose to wear have an impact on animals lives.    Public protests reach a wider audience than the speakers, educational programs and other events that PAWS sponsors, Palmer explained. Protests like the one at Frist aim to alert the public to see the controversy over fur as a wider issue, she said.    While such demonstrations are perfectly within PAWS right to free speech, the graphic nature of the protest might give a negative impression to prospective students and people trying to get a sense of the University, Haley Thompson 11 said.    There are a lot of people [who saw the demonstration] who arent students here, and they might find it offensive, Thompson explained.    For Thompson though, wearing Uggs remains a personal decision, much like being a vegetarian. You do the same thing when you sit down and eat a hamburger, Thompson noted. I dont feel like its all that different, and Im not a vegetarian.    Seeing the demonstration did not change her mind, she added. Im still going to wear my Uggs.    There should be limits, however, to personal choice, Palmer said. We appreciate the right of people to make their own choices up to the point where it affects others, she said.    Because animals may be crammed into cruel slaughterhouses and gassed, decapitated or electrocuted, however, individuals must be especially conscious of the implications of their clothing decisions, Palmer said.    People dont have the right to cause that kind of pain, even if they choose to, she explained.    Barnard said he hopes, however, that the event caused people to reflect on their fashion choices. If just a few people are affected by it, its a success, he said. Just a few people can make a difference.    Barnard also said that the event took over a month to plan and was delayed by concerns that students might misinterpret the bloody scene as a reference to Virginia Tech and similar incidents.    Last year, PAWS and PETA joined forces in front of Frist to protest killing the killing of animals for food. The demonstration featured students representing packaged human meat in an effort to advocate vegetarianism. ",Ugg boots are made from sheepskin.,test

The detergent packets are designed to dissolve when wet, so even putting them in one's mouth can be dangerous.    Pat Sullivan/AP    Already in 2018 there has been a steep spike in the number of cases of teens misusing laundry pods. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) said approximately 40 cases have been reported so far, ""of which around half were intentionally ingested.""    Laundry-detergent packets commonly known as ""pods"" have been flagged before as a safety issue for young children. The small, colorful pods can be mistaken for candy by children.    In 2017, the AAPCC said there were reports of more than 10,000 exposures to highly-concentrated packets of laundry detergent by children ages 5 and under.    Children who consume pods can quickly become very sick and lose consciousness, according to Dr. Alfred Aleguas, managing director of the Florida Poison Information Center.    Consuming the pods can also be lethal.    ""Currently we are aware of about 10 deaths since laundry pods came out into the market many years ago,"" said Buerkle.    Procter and Gamble, maker of Tide Pods, told ABC News in a statement that the pods should not be played with, whatever the circumstance is.    Nothing is more important to us than the safety of people who use our products, the statement read. They should not be played with, whatever the circumstance is, even if meant as a joke.

Mr Trump this weekend attended the Values Voter Summer held by the Family Research Council, where he spoke amid a string of anti-LGBT activists.    The FRC is listed as an active anti-LGBT hate group by extremism watchdog the Southern Poverty Law Center, with the groups president Tony Perkins repeatedly blaming gay people for the Holocaust, claiming they will attempt another one.    Perkins has made a number of extremely disturbing claims about LGBT people in the past, insisting that gays will attempt a Christian Holocaust.    Perkins also compares gays to paedophiles, insisting: While activists like to claim that paedophilia is a completely distinct orientation from homosexuality, evidence shows a disproportionate overlap between the two. It is a homosexual problem.    Despite former Presidential hopefuls Mitt Romney and John McCain both snubbing the groups summit previously, Trump attended on Friday.    In his speech to the group, Mr Trump turned a blind eye to their long history of stirring anti-LGBT hate sentiment, focusing on generic religious liberty.    He said: I wanted to thank our host, Tony Perkins, for his years of leadership Thank you. Amazing, amazing group.    Trump continued: So let me say this right up front: A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended, like youve never seen before.    Believe me. I believe it. And you believe it. And you know it. You know it. And that includes religious liberty.    In his speech, Trump pledged to scrap the Johnson Amendment, which bans tax-exempt churches from directly endorsing or opposing political candidates, effectively giving a turbo-boost to the work of the FRC.    He said: The Johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits. If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, theyre unable to do so.    If I become president, we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment. We are going to do that. And its not going to be hard.    He also vowed to appoint more justices like the late Justice Scalia, who was known for his bitter dissents against pro-LGBT rulings. Scalia consistently opposed LGBT rights rulings on the court, from the repeal of sodomy laws right through to the equal marriage.    Trump said: Earlier this year, we lost the great justice, Antonin Scalia.    The next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others and you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country. It will be a disaster.    We are going to put truly great people. Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what were looking for, OK?    I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution, to protect your religious liberty, and apply the law as written.    Trump also praised anti-sodomy campaigner Phyllis Schlafly.    He continued: Our country just lost one of the great champions for the American family, Phyllis Schlafly. Great woman, really great woman. We send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones. I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St. Louis.    Phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America.    She understood that, to be truly united as a country, we cant simply turn to government or to politicians. The bedrock of our unity is the realisation that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God. Phyllis understood that. Phyllis understood that.    Trump has faced questions about his ties to Perkins in the past.    Earlier this year, when Trump was mocked for misquoting the Bible in a speech, he revealed it had been co-written by Mr Perkins.    He later made a $100,000 donation to Perkins church raising serious questions about financial conduct.

His recently released budget proposal makes it clear hes going to follow through on those threats.    One popular program facing elimination is Meals On Wheels, which uses federal funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to mobilize volunteers, businesses and donors to provide nutrition to thousands of senior citizens on a daily basis. It supports over 5,000 community-based organizations across America, reaching people in both urban and rural areas.    The money for Meals On Wheels is part of the Older American Act, first passed in 1965 as part of LBJs Great Society, and endorsed by every president until Trump.

The total cost, which includes other programs, is about $2 billion a year, which is less than the government hands out in fossil fuel subsidies every year.    On top of that, Trumps On top of that, Trumps proposed budget would drastically reduce the budget of the Food For Peace program, a State Department program that distributes desperately needed food supplies to areas across the globe that have been hit by famine or natural disaster. Since its creation in 1954 by President Eisenhower, it has helped feed more than 3 billion people.    It too has a budget It too has a budget that barely scratches $2 billion dollars a drop in the bucket compared to the $54 billion that Trump is planning to pour into the military budget.    Overall, the entire State Department budget also faces the ax, with a proposal to cut the $50 billion budget by almost one-third. It could have been worse, but Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made a plea to ease the cuts, which in an earlier version were at a staggering 37 percent.    The needless cuts to critically important programs like Meals on Wheels and Food For Peace are literally taking food out of the mouths of hungry people. The State Departments work around the world helps millions of people and builds much-needed goodwill for Americas international reputation, which has been dragged through the mud by President Trumps abrasive isolationism.    Luckily, there was immediately Republican opposition to many of the proposed cuts. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky says his party will not go along with the massive cuts to the State Department budget. Among the cuts, he said Republicans will oppose cuts in funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development.     and this is how hes choosing to repay them.

On a vote of 57-43, the Senate backed the resolution, just one of several early steps by the Republican-led Congress to undo regulations implemented by former President Barack Obama. The House had passed the measure earlier this year. The White House has signaled Trump will sign the legislation.    The Obama rule would have prevented an estimated 75,000 people with mental disorders from being able to purchase a firearm. It was crafted as part of Obama's efforts to strengthen the federal background check system in the wake of the 2012 massacre of 20 young students and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.    Adam Lanza, a 20-year-old man with a variety of impairments, including Asperger's syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder, shot and killed his mother at their home, then went to school where he killed the students, adults and himself. He used his mother's guns in the attack.    The Obama administration rule required the Social Security Administration to send in the names of beneficiaries with mental impairments who also have a third party manage their benefits.    But lawmakers, with the backing of the National Rifle Association and advocacy groups for the disabled, opposed the regulation and encouraged Congress to undertake a rarely successful parliamentary tool designed to void regulations that Congress takes issue with.    With a Republican ally in the White House, the GOP has moved aggressively on several fronts to rescind some of the Obama administration's final regulations on the environment, financial reporting and now guns. Under an expedited process established through the Congressional Review Act, a regulation is made invalid when a simple majority of both chambers pass a joint resolution of disapproval and the president signs it.    The House also voted to repeal three Labor Department regulations Wednesday, including a rule that established when states could require drug testing for certain laid-off workers seeking unemployment insurance. Critics seeking the repeal said the department crafted the regulation so narrowly that it undermined congressional intent to give states more leeway to use drug testing in their unemployment insurance programs.    On the gun rule, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, spearheaded the repeal effort, saying the regulation unfairly stigmatizes the disabled and infringes on their constitutional right to bear arms. He said that the mental disorders covered through the regulation are filled with ""vague characteristics that do not fit into the federal mentally defective standard"" prohibiting someone from buying or owning a gun.    Grassley cited eating and sleep disorders as examples of illnesses that could allow a beneficiary to be reported to the background check system if they also have a third party to manage their benefits.    Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he didn't know how he could explain to his constituents, including those in Newtown, that Congress was making it easier rather than harder for people with serious mental illness to have a gun.    ""If you can't manage your own financial affairs, how can we expect that you're going to be a responsible steward of a dangerous, lethal firearm,"" Murphy said.    Gun rights groups weren't the only organizations upset about the Obama administration's regulation. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized it, too. The ACLU said the rule advanced a harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, ""a vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent."" More than a dozen advocacy groups for the disabled also opposed the Obama administration's regulation.    ""This heartless resolution puts the most vulnerable Americans at risk,"" countered Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""Make no mistake, this vote was really about deepening the gun industry's customer pool, at the expense of those in danger of hurting themselves or others.""    On the labor rule, Mississippi, Wisconsin and Texas are among the states seeking more flexibility in using drug tests in their unemployment insurance programs. Republicans complained that the Obama administration regulation undercut that flexibility and congressional intent.    ""I am pretty certain that the people who I am privileged to represent would be very upset if they thought somebody was receiving unemployment compensation while they were on drugs, because they think that is going to make it pretty hard for that person to ever get back into the workforce, and they want to be able to identify that,"" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla.    Democrats argued that Republicans were simply enabling states to intimidate people from seeking unemployment benefits.    ""The legislation that we are debating today has nothing to do with fighting drug abuse,"" said Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass. ""It's about allowing states to put one more time-consuming, humiliating obstacle in the way of Americans who work hard, and were laid off from their jobs and need unemployment insurance to pay the bills while they look for new jobs.""

So when a potential Trump cabinet pick gets photographed openly holding sensitive documents, its appropriate to wonder where the outrage is.    Kansas Secretary of State and avowed Islamophobe Kris Kobach is being considered to lead the Department of Homeland Security, but failed to put his plans for said agency in a folder, or have a cover sheet, or anything at all to prevent the public fromooming into them:    LIKE THIS:    The documents appear to contain Kobachs heinous anti-Muslim plans, including expanding the NSEERS (National Security Entry-Exit Registration System) program and reducing the intake of refugees fleeing the mass slaughter of Syrian civilians toero. Those are his literal first priorities.    Kobach created the NSEERS program with John Ashcroft while serving under President Bush. It registered men from 25 predominantly Muslim nations, fingerprinting and questioning them. The program was ended in 2003 and succeeded in deporting 14,000 Muslims who overstayed visas but did not produce a single terrorism arrest and was considered an abject failure by the Bush Administration.    Even folks within the Bush administration we worked with at the time knew that it was a waste of time and a waste of resources. Its clearly profiling. Its clearly singling out Arabs and Muslims. Its a very problematic program, said Abed Ayoub, legal director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.    From the accounts we received at the time, it was simply a massive bureaucracy where people would go into the office, be asked some questions and nothing came of it. And in the process, it caused an incredible amount of fear and also almost certainly it inhibited the efforts to gain actionable information from communities that we need to work with to actually combat important threats said Raj Goyle, an ACLU lawyer.    It appears that Kobach is still intent on using this program as a discriminatory tool to register and surveil Muslims as well as finding excuses to deport them. The plan itself is absolutely appalling; the way it was revealed to the public is just as disturbing.

Content can be viewed at actual source page: _LINKS_    How many U.S. veterans are deported each year? No one knows, but a group of ""banished veterans"" in Mexico are trying to help.     Hector Barajas lives in a rundown apartment in Rosarito, Mexico. His small living room is cluttered with makeshift items appropriated as furniture: upended 20-gallon bucket chairs, chipped TV dinner trays trying to stand alone on teetering bent legs. There's even a door-less broken fridge that serves as a bookshelf.    After growing up in Compton, California, Barajas served for seven years in the U.S Army's 82nd Airborne Division. He had a green card, and was proud to serve what he considered to be his country.    Now, Barajas says, he never imagined he'd be banned for life from the United States.    ""I was a legal resident when I entered the military in 1995,"" he said. ""I got out in 2001 with two honorable discharges. I was under the impression that I was a U.S. citizen automatically because of the recruiters.""    That wasn't the case. Though military service can speed up the process of becoming a citizen, it's not automatic. Barajas got into trouble after leaving the military, and was convicted for discharging a firearm into a vehicle. He served a 3-year prison sentence. Because he had a green card, the conviction meant that he was subject to mandatory deportation.    If he had been a U.S. citizen, Barajas would have walked free after serving his time. Instead, he was taken into ICE custody, brought across the border, and dropped off in Tijuana.    His family remained behind in California.    For the first few months, Barajas struggled to adjust. With help from another deported veteran, he found a modest apartment in Rosarito, about 15 miles south of the border. He's been there since 2004.    At first, Barajas says, he found work in a senior care facility in his neighborhood, tending to elderly American retirees. The job paid poorly, and didn't last. His hopes of eventually returning to the U.S. and a desire to help other deported vets led him to his next job: a fulltime, unpaid, effort.    Barajas decided to use his cramped living quarters as a makeshift drop-in shelter, which quickly became the headquarters of the growing organization ""Banished Veterans.""    ""I'm doing something that somebody did for me, when I first got here,"" Barajas said. ""You're supposed to take care, you're supposed to leave no man behind. I'm a firm believer""    He trailed off, looked around, and chuckled. ""I mean, to the best of your ability. This is a small apartment.""    Fabian Rebolledo, 36, is a recent arrival to Mexico. He's a Kosovo combat vet and former Army paratrooper. Rebolledo arrived just four months ago, after spending twenty-four years in Los Angeles.    ""My deportation was due to a violation of probation,"" he said. ""It was due to a insufficient funds check. Seven hundred fifty dollars.""    Like Barajas, Rebolledo thought that military service would protect him.    ""I was a legal resident,"" he said. ""And actually, I joined the military because I wanted to become a citizen. I was going to be the first member of my family to become a citizen""    But before the bad check, Rebolledo had two DUI convictions. Although his crimes were nonviolent, they were still enough to ban him from the U.S. for the rest of his life.    That's because of a 1996 immigration law that expanded the list of crimes considered to be ""aggravated felonies."" The law made some misdemeanor crimes result in permanent, mandatory deportation for non-citizens.    Today, Hector and his fellow banned veterans would like to see some judicial discretion come into play in these cases, taking military service into account. Some politicians, like Bob Filner, former Chairman of the House Committee on Veteran's Affairs and newly elected Mayor of San Diego, have shown some sympathy for these efforts.        Right now, not only is there no judicial review there's also no one keeping count of how many vets are deported.    ""No, no,"" said Lauren Mack, spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in San Diego. ""We don't track vets.""    Neither does anyone else.    Immigration attorney Craig Shagin says that getting hard numbers is impossible. Even attorneys representing vets in court, ""may not even be asking their clients, 'have you ever served in the military?' Because it isn't an outcome affirmative of anything, it's not going to change anything.""    From the Banned Vet headquarters in his Rosarito apartment, Barajas has been keeping a tally. ""I started making a list of for the hell of it,"" he said. ""It grew into something bigger, something people want to know about.""    Today, he says, he's spoken personally to 103 U.S. military veterans who have been deported to various countries. He estimates that between 500 and 1000 deported vets live in Tijuana and Rosarito alone, with thousands more scattered around the world.    Barajas is searching for other deported vets and trying to rally them and others. It's a lot like amateur detective work. He makes phones calls, follows leads, sends Facebook requests, and tracks social media.    Vets who commit crimes, do time, and are then deported can still be eligible for benefits. However, it's impossible for them to collect most of those benefits.        Nevertheless, there is one benefit they can collect: burial.    ""We had a guy who died about four months ago,"" Barajas said. ""He was deported, not allowed to go into the U.S. When (he) died, they let his body go. And then they gave him a nice certificate, thank you for serving our country. When I die, I can be buried as an American.""    It's true. Unless they've been dishonorably discharged, the Office of Veteran's Affairs says that all military veterans are indeed entitled to a burial in a national cemetery.    Immigration law doesn't restrict the corpses of veterans from coming ""home"" to American soil.    Only then can deported vets re-enter the country legally, in order to be laid to rest as American service members: with a grave marker and a American flag.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/white-wilderness/http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=56,ftrue," Alaska Fish &amp; Wildlife News    September 2003    Lemming Suicide Myth    Disney Film Faked Bogus Behavior    By Riley Woodford    Lemmings do not commit mass suicide. It's a myth, but it's remarkable how many people believe it. Ask a few.    ""It's a complete urban legend,"" said state wildlife biologist Thomas McDonough. ""I think it blew out of proportion based on a Disney documentary in the '50s, and that brought it to the mainstream.""    Lemmings are a kind of short tailed vole, a mouse-like rodent that favors tundra and open grasslands. Three kinds are found in Alaska, including the collared lemming, the only rodent that turns white in winter.    In 1958 Walt Disney produced ""White Wilderness,"" part of the studio's ""True Life Adventure"" series. ""White Wilderness"" featured a segment on lemmings, detailing their strange compulsion to commit mass suicide.    According to a 1983 investigation by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation producer Brian Vallee, the lemming scenes were faked. The lemmings supposedly committing mass suicide by leaping into the ocean were actually thrown off a cliff by the Disney filmmakers. The epic ""lemming migration"" was staged using careful editing, tight camera angles and a few dozen lemmings running on snow covered lazy-Susan style turntable.    ""White Wilderness"" was filmed in Alberta, Canada, a landlocked province, and not on location in lemmings' natural habitat. There are about 20 lemming species found in the circumpolar north - but evidently not in that area of Alberta. So the Disney people bought lemmings from Inuit children a couple provinces away in Manitoba and staged the whole sequence.    In the lemming segment, the little rodents assemble for a mass migration, scamper across the tundra and ford a tiny stream as narrator Winston Hibbler explains that, ""A kind of compulsion seizes each tiny rodent and, carried along by an unreasoning hysteria, each falls into step for a march that will take them to a strange destiny.""    That destiny is to jump into the ocean. As they approach the ""sea,"" (actually a river -more tight cropping) Hibbler continues, ""They've become victims of an obsession -- a one-track thought: Move on! Move on!""    The ""pack of lemmings"" reaches the final precipice. ""This is the last chance to turn back,"" Hibbler states. ""Yet over they go, casting themselves out bodily into space.""    Life-loving lemming: lemmings do not commit mass suicide, although in lean times they may become cannibalistic. These mouse-like rodents are found in Alaska and in northern countries around the world, mostly favoring tundra and open grassland.    Lemmings are seen flying into the water. The final shot shows the sea awash with dying lemmings.    Certainly, some scenes in nature documentaries are staged. In Sir David Attenborough's recent documentary, ""The Life of Birds,"" the close-up footage of a flying duck, filmed razor-sharp from the bird's wingtip, was shot from a car using a mallard drake trained to fly alongside the car. But faking an entirely mythical event is something else.    ""Disney had to have gotten that idea from somewhere,"" said Thomas McDonough, the state wildlife biologist. Disney likely confused dispersal with migration, he added, and embellished a kernel of truth.    Lemming populations fluctuate enormously based on predators, food, climate and other factors. Under ideal conditions, in a single year a population of voles can increase by a factor of ten. When they've exhausted the local food supply, they disperse, as do moose, beaver and many other animals.    Lemmings can swim and will cross bodies of water in their quest for greener pastures. Sometimes they drown. Dispersal and accidental death is a far cry from the instinctive, deliberate mass suicide depicted in ""White Wilderness,"" but Hibbler explains that life is tough in the lemmings' ""weird world of frozen chaos."" The voice-over implies that lemmings take the plunge every seven to ten years to alleviate overpopulation.    ""What people see is essentially mass dispersal,"" saidoologist Gordon Jarrell, an expert in small mammals with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ""Sometimes it's pretty directional. The classic example is in the Scandinavian mountains, where (lemmings) have been dramatically observed. They will come to a body of water and be temporarily stopped, and eventually they'll build up along the shore so dense and they will swim across. If they get wet to the skin, they 're essentially dead.""    ""There's no question that at times they will build up to huge numbers,"" Jarrell added. ""One description from Barrow does talk about them drowning and piling up on the shore.""    Jarrell said when people learn that he works with lemmings, the mass suicide issue often comes up.    ""It's a frequent question,"" he said ""'Do they really kill themselves?' No. The answer is unequivocal, no they don't.""    Receive a monthly notice about new issues and articles.

Greg Hilburn/USA Today Network    Commissioner of Administration Jay Dardenne and Louisiana Department of Health Secretary Rebekah Gee held a press conference Wednesday to discuss nursing home eviction warning notices to be mailed Thursday. (Photo: Greg Hilburn/USA Today Network)    BATON ROUGE Nursing home eviction notice warnings to be sent Thursday are likely to create a panic among the 37,000 Louisianans and their families who could be victims of the state's budget crisis.    Gov. John Bel Edwards' chief financial officer said the state was compelled to warn those affected, though not legally bound to do so at a specific time.    ""I agree it's going to be alarming, but it's the responsible thing to do,"" said Commissioner of Administration Jay Dardenne, who said the warnings allow those affected to seek other options and the state to explore whether they may qualify for other assistance.    More: Nursing home eviction notices to be sent Thursday    Department of Health Secretary Rebekah Gee became emotional during the press conference, saying through tears, ""These are real people. We know their stories.""    ""Our hearts are breaking, but we can't provide services without money,"" Gee said.    More: 'What were you thinking?' A parent reacts to nursing home eviction notices    But Republican lawmakers said sending the letters now is premature and a political stunt by Edwards, a Democrat, to pressure the Legislature to raise taxes.    ""This is the lowest of the low in my 45 years of public service, and it's started a panic that's unnecessary; calls are pouring into our offices,"" said Sen. Jim Fannin, R-Jonesboro. ""This is nothing more than a political maneuver and an ugly one for folks at the most vulnerable time of their lives.""    CLOSE Sen. Jim Fannin, R-Jonesboro, said the Department of Health could have delayed sending notices to 37,000 people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. ""This is a political maneuver and an ugly one."" Greg Hilburn/USA Today Network    House Republicans held a press conference Wednesday afternoon with Rep. Chairman Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, saying the governor is needlessly ""striking fear into the elderly of our state.""    Henry, chairman of Appropriations Committee that crafts the budget, said sending the letters now ""is premature at best and reckless at worst.""    Dardenne dismissed the criticism, saying, ""This letter is scary, but it's not a tactic.""    ""We're allowing people as much time as possible to plan,"" Gee said.    Even those generally aligned with the governor acknowledge the impact of the letters. ""People are going to be frantic,"" Sen. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, said during a Senate committee hearing.    Those who will be warned they could lose their Medicaid coverage include about 20,000 nursing home residents, 10,000 other long-term care residents with developmental disabilities and 7,000 who have provisional Medicaid insurance.    Next year's budget begins July 1, which is when the evictions could technically begin.    The budget passed by the House and sent to the Senate contains deep cuts to health care because of a shortfall of between $550 million and $648 million, depending on who's doing the calculations.    Next year's shortfall was created because about $1.4 billion in temporary taxes expire June 30. The bulk of the expiring taxes, about $880 million, comes from a one-cent sales tax.    Edwards wants lawmakers to mitigate the cuts with new permanent taxes in a special session, but the Legislature declined to raise any new taxes in a February special session.    ""This is an unfortunate, inevitable consequence of inaction (by the Legislature),"" Dardenne said.    State Rep. Katrina Jackson, D-Monroe, said she believes the timing of the notices are prudent.    ""There's an imminent threat,"" she said. ""The Legislature convened a special session once earlier this year to remedy this problem, but it failed to do so.    ""This is the reality that we face when we fail to act appropriately for the good of the people of this state. It is my sincere hope and prayer that the Legislature will convene another special session to remedy this issue and the many other issues that will cripple the people of this state if they are not addressed.""    Nursing home and group home operators said the possibility of eviction is unthinkable.    ""This is our cry for help,"" said Laurie Boswell, chief executive of Holy Angels in Shreveport, said during a Senate committee hearing. ""There is no place for them to go.""    ""Our residents require 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week care to eat, toilet and bathe,"" said Mark Berger, executive director of the Louisiana Nursing Home Association. ""They can't go home.""    Gee said the department will expand hours at its call center to answer questions from residents who will receive the letters.

Dana Sedgewick, 44, from Sheffield, trimmed her pubic area with a brand new razor but ended up cutting a spot on her groin.    Her body almost immediately went into shock, causing a red rash on her legs before they turned black from necrotising fasciitis - a flesh-eating infection.    Rushed to intensive care, doctors operated to remove as much of the rotting skin as they could - but she developed sepsis during the procedure.    She was placed in a coma as her family were told she had just a 30 per cent chance of survival as her kidneys failed and her heart stopped four times.    Having managed to survive the horrific ordeal, she underwent 21 operations to repair the damage to her skin - but doctors warned she would never walk again.    But with the support of her husband, Mathew, 47, she has now recovered and can walk using crutches and is back at home with her children - Megan, 18, Freya, 14, and Klara, nine.    Dana Sedgewick, 44, trimmed her pubic area with a brand new razor, but ended up in a coma after she developed the flesh-eating infection, necrotising fasciitis (pictured now, using a crutch to walk - despite being told she may never be able to use her legs again)    Mrs Sedgewick said: 'Like a lot of women, I tried to keep a tidy bikini line. So I had a quick trim with a new razor.    'But over the weekend, I felt unwell and noticed a little pimple on my groin which kept bleeding. I didn't think anything of it as I often got a rash from shaving.    'Little did I know that this tiny pimple would almost cost me my life.'    Mrs Sedgewick's ordeal began in May 2012. Two days after she'd shaved, she began experiencing dizziness and nausea.    She visited her GP, who took swabs of the area and prescribed her antibiotics to combat a suspected infection.    Later that day, her eldest daughter Megan discovered her lying in bed, with her legs covered in a bloody red rash.    Her body almost immediately went into shock, causing a red rash on her legs before they turned black from the rotting flesh (pictured in September 2012 after a couple of skin graft procedures to repair some of the damage on her legs)    Afterwards, her GP called to say that the swabs had revealed it was serious and that she needed to go in for another examination.    But when her husband dropped her off at the surgery, she collapsed.     Like a lot of women, I tried to keep a tidy bikini line. So I had a quick trim with a new razor Dana Sedgewick, 44    An ambulance was called and she was rushed to the trauma unit at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, where doctors diagnosed her with necrotising fasciitis.    The condition causes bacteria to release toxins that attack the surrounding soft tissue, and can be caused by a minor cut or scratch.    Mrs Sedgewick said: 'By the time I got to the hospital, my legs were covered in black, rotting flesh. It was touch-and-go as to whether I'd make it.'    Over the next ten hours, surgeons battled to save her legs. Cutting through seven inches of infected skin, they removed the diseased flesh and reapplied skin from her back.    Rushed to intensive care, doctors placed her in a coma as her family were told she had just a 30 per cent chance of survival as her kidneys failed and her heart stopped four times (pictured at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield in May 2012)    Having managed to come round from the horrific ordeal, she underwent 21 operations to repair the damage to her skin - but doctors warned she would never walk again (pictured in hospital suffering from the infection)    The condition causes bacteria to release toxins that attack the surrounding soft tissue, and can be caused by a minor cut or scratch (pictured: her legs now after having the operations to repair the damage that was caused)    Doctors told Mrs Sedgewick that she had been very lucky to survive her terrifying ordeal with necrotising fasciitis (pictured in hospital in June 2012)    During surgery, she developed sepsis and was given a slim chance of survival after going into septic shock.    The silent killer strikes when an infection such as blood poisoning sparks a violent immune response in which the body attacks its own organs.    To increase her chances of survival, doctors decided to put her into an induced coma for nine days.    She said: 'When I woke up, my legs were covered in bandages and I had no idea what had happened. I thought I'd been in a car accident.    'But when the surgeon asked me if I remembered shaving, I suddenly recalled trimming my bikini line.    'He told me that the spot on my groin had become infected, and I'd been very lucky to survive.'    Mrs Sedgewick was transferred to the hospital's burns unit for specialist treatment, and was able to see her legs for the first time.    She said: 'It was horrific. All of my muscle had rotted away, and I had a crater of skin near my groin. I felt like I was going to throw up.    'But I knew that it could have been much, much worse. I could easily have lost my legs - or worse, died.'    Mrs Sedgewick was transferred to the hospital's burns unit for specialist treatment, and was able to see her legs for the first time (pictured in hospital in June 2012)    But with the support of her husband, Mathew, 47, she has now recovered and is back at home with her children - Megan, 18, Freya, 14, and Klara, nine (the family are pictured before Mrs Sedgewick's ordeal on a day out to Endcliffe Park, Sheffield, on Christmas Day 2016)    WHAT IS NECROTISING FASCIITIS? Necrotising fasciitis is most commonly caused by an infection with group A Streptococcus. Those infections normally last just a few days - they are mild and typically clear themselves up. But in some unusual cases it can develop into necrotising fasciitis. They infect flat layers of a membrane known as the fascia, which are connective bands of tissue that surround muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels. The infection also damages the tissues next to the fascia. Sometimes toxins made by these bacteria destroy the tissue they infect, causing it to die. When this happens, the infection is very serious and can result in loss of limbs or death. .    Doctors warned that she'd never walk again but she defied them and managed to walk on crutches, after intense physiotherapy.    Six weeks later, she was discharged from hospital.    Over the next four years, she underwent 21 operations to improve the appearance of her skin.    Mrs Sedgewick, who has been left with extensive scarring, said: 'It didn't feel like my own body any more.    'But with Mat's support, I grew to see the scars as a reminder of how brave I'd been, and how lucky I was to survive.    'It's incredible to think a tiny shaving spot could have killed me. I had a very close shave indeed.'    Dr Ron Daniels BEM, chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust, said: 'Stories like Dana's illustrate the serious damage sepsis can do. Every day in the UK, individuals and families have their lives torn apart by the condition.    'But through better awareness, thousands of lives could be saved each year.    'While necrotising fasciitis is a rare cause of sepsis, it's crucial that members of the public and healthcare professionals consider it when presented with an unwell patient.    'Anyone with flu-like symptoms and one or more of the key signs of sepsis must call an ambulance immediately. With every hour that passes before the correct antibiotics are administered, the risk of death increases.'    Mrs Sedgewick, who has been left with extensive scarring, said: 'It didn't feel like my own body any more. But with Mat's support, I grew to see the scars as a reminder of how brave I'd been' (pictured with her 47-year-old husband Mathew after the ordeal) ","After shaving her legs, a woman developed a life-threatening skin infection that required the removal of massive amounts of skin and muscle tissue.",test

Sam Kanizay, 16, was soaking his legs in the water at Dendy Street Beach in Brighton, Melbourne, on Saturday evening when he said he felt his legs tingling.    He told Fairfax Media he presumed it was because his legs were sore from playing football and the water was cold.    But after coming out of the water about 30 minutes later, he found his legs were covered in tiny sores which were oozing with blood.    Sam Kanizay, 16, emerged from the ocean where he had been soaking his legs to find dozens of tiny bites that would not stop bleeding    Pictured: Sam was treated by medical staff at two hospitals over the weekend, who could not stem the bleeding    It is believed Sam has dozens of pin prick-sized bites on his feet and legs (pictured)    'My first instinct was that I must have stepped on a rock,' he said.    'But I realised that couldn't have been it, because it was evenly distributed over my whole ankle and foot.'    After attempts to stop the bleeding were unsuccessful, the teenager spent his weekend at two different hospitals, where doctors also tried and failed to stop the sores from bleeding.    One nurse advised the bites could be from sea lice, but it was no more than a 'guess'.    WHAT ARE SEA LICE? Pictured: A sea louse Sea lice which cause tiny, pin-prick like bites are a miniscule jellyfish or stinger larvae. They have the same stinging cells as an adult jellyfish, though they can only attack a small area because of their size. Source: Oceanfit .    Sam's father Jarrod said the teenager was a 'stoic kid' and he was expecting his son to make a full recovery    A nurse told the teenager the bites might have been from sea lice, but she was only guessing    Sam's father Jarrod said his son's injury 'fascinated' all of the staff working in the emergency room at Sandringham Hospital.    'They were all on Google afterwards, hypothesising as to what happened,' he said.    'They pretty much had 10 different hypotheses but nothing yet.'    Mr Kanizay told Daily Mail Australia on Sunday night the bleeding had finally stopped, and he had high hopes for a quick and full recovery.    'Sam is a stoic kid, so he will be fine,' he said.    Sam told News Corp he would probably use the pool to ice his legs in the future, but it wouldn't keep him away from the beach completely.    'Plenty of people go for a swim in there so it's probably just a one-off thing,' he said.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bills-introduced-by-republicans/http://archive.is/zXeMT,mtrue," The Republican-led Congress is wasting no time forcing through the most horrendous bills seen in decades while Americas eyes are on Russia.    With both houses of Congress solidly under Republican control, theres little in the way to stop House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) from sending bills to President Trumps desk that embody the most dangerous aspects of radical right-wing ideology.    However unlikely these bills passage would have seemed in the 114th Congress, the possibility of these nine bills becoming law is much higher now, especially considering the flurry of headlines around Donald Trumps ties to Russia, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recusal on the ongoing investigation into the presidents Russian connections, and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyaks multiple meetings with several of Trumps top lieutenants.    Here are the nine worst bills to keep an eye on:    1. H.R. 861: To terminate the Environmental Protection Agency    This bill cosponsored by Republican members of Congress from fossil fuel-producing states is just one sentence long, and says nothing about what would happen to the multiple environmental regulations the EPA has instituted since 1970, or its multibillion-dollar budget, or its thousands of staffers. H.R. 861 is currently awaiting action in the subcommittee on environment.    2. H.R. 610: Tax dollars for private schools    Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) introduced this bill in January, which would redistribute funding earmarked for public schools in the form of vouchers for parents to send children to private schools. Over the long term, this would eventually bankrupt public schools, and create a stratified education system in which cash-strapped public schools would be unable to meet the educational needs of low-income students. The bill is awaiting action in the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.    3. H.R. 899: To terminate the Department of Education    If this bill, introduced by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), becomes law, the U.S. Department of Education would terminate by the end of 2018. The bills brevity leaves many questions unanswered, like what would happen with Department of Education grants for public schools and universities, its budget, or its staff. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has said she would personally be fine if the agency she heads were to be abolished    4. H.J.R. 69: To repeal a rule protecting wildlife    Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), whose constituents likely include hunters who kill wildlife for sport rather than for food, introduced this joint resolution voicing displeasure with a Department of Interior rule that prohibits non-subsistence hunting in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The resolution passed the House and is awaiting action in the Senate.    5. H.R. 370: To repeal the Affordable Care Act    While President Obama was in office, House Republicans voted at least 60 times to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare despite its futility. However, the Trump administration has made the repeal of Obamacare a top priority, meaning the repeal bill from Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas) is likely to pass.    6. H.R. 354: To defund Planned Parenthood    Despite the widely publicized debunking of the video alleging the womens health nonprofit was selling human organs, Republicans are still refusing to stop destroying Planned Parenthood. Rep. Diane Black (R-Tennessee) introduced a bill that would prevent any federal grants from going to Planned Parenthood for a full year unless they swore to not perform abortions. As the chart below from Planned Parenthood shows, only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood resources go toward abortions, while the vast majority of funding is used to help low-income women get STD tests, contraceptive care, and breast cancer screenings:    7. H.R. 785: National Right-to-Work legislation    Conservative ideologue Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) is aiming to cripple unions at the nationwide level with a bill that would systematically deprive labor unions of the funding they need to operate. Unions often provide one of the crucial pillars of support for Democratic candidates and causes, and conservatives aim to destroy them once and for all by going after their funding. Its important to note that right-to-work is bad for all workers, not just union members in 2015, the Economic Policy Institute learned that wages in right-to-work states are roughly 3.2 percent lower than in non-right-to-work states.    8. H.R. 83: Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act    Multiple cities and states around the country have openly stated that they wont abide by President Trumps plan to aggressively round up and deport undocumented immigrants. A bill by Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pennsylvania) would strip all federal funding of any city that doesnt obey Trumps immigration policies for up to a year.    9. H.R. 147: To criminalize abortion    Rep. Trent Franks (R-Arizona) wants to aggressively prosecute pregnant women seeking abortions, along with abortion providers, by making abortion a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. The bill is currently awaiting action in the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice.    To fight back against these bills, call 202-224-3121, ask for your member of Congress, and tell them to vote no.    . ",Legislation introduced by Republicans during President Trump's first two months in office included bills to: terminate the Environmental Protection Agency; redistribute federal school funding via voucher programs; terminate the Dept. of Education; repeal a wildlife protection rule; repeal the Affordable Care Act; defund Planned Parenthood; establish a national right-to-work law; strip federal funds from sanctuary cities; criminalize abortion; and place new sanctions on Iran.,test

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/can-you-use-peanut-butter-to-diagnose-alzheimers-disease/https://www.davidwolfe.com/peanut-butter-diagnose-alzheimers/,mfalse," Pin +1 Share 8K Shares    Alzheimers is the most common form of dementia, affecting more than five million Americans. Every 66 seconds, someone in the United States develops Alzheimers. It ranks as the 6th leading cause of death in the U.S. Its a progressive disease, worsening over a number of years. As Alzheimers advances, it leads to worsening symptoms. They include disorientation, mood and behavior changes, deepening confusion, unfounded suspicions, serious memory loss and difficulty speaking, swallowing and walking.    Alzheimers can be devastating to those diagnosed, their family members and their friends. There is no known cure for the disease. However, early intervention is often key to a longer lifespan and a better quality of living. Alzheimers can be extremely difficult to diagnose in early stages. Having trouble remembering things does not mean a person has Alzheimers. Thanks to the University of Floridas McKnight Brain Institute Center for Smell and Taste, earlier diagnoses of Alzheimers may be possible.    Using just a scoop of peanut butter and a ruler, clinicians have discovered a way to change lives and provide an early diagnosis for Alzheimers. They found a way to give millions of people a chance to make more memories. This method of early diagnosis can help predict and address the disease before it becomes completely overwhelming for those diagnosed.                    Heres how it works.    The study involved participants with Alzheimers and other forms of dementia. Participants were asked to close their eyes and attempt to detect an odor with one nostril at a time. Researchers used a small container of peanut butter to measure the distance from each nostril that the participants were able to detect the odor. The study found that people with Alzheimers disease have a harder time detecting odors from their left nostril when compared to their right nostril.    Jennifer Stamps, a University of Florida researcher explained, All of the Alzheimers patients had a left nostril impairment and their right nostril was normal at odor detection which is about 20 centimeters for an older person. Their right nostril was right at 20 centimeters on average but their left nostril was about 10 centimeters on average where they were able to detect it, so there was a big asymmetry there.    So why peanut butter? Because it has a strong, familiar smell. People with Alzheimers can lose their ability to smell even before memory problems arise. Using this method to detect Alzheimers early can help doctors slow down the effects of the disease. The peanut butter test is a faster and cheaper was for doctors to confirm an Alzheimers diagnosis.    Check out the video below for more information on using the peanut butter test as a form of early detection for Alzheimers.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/catholic-school-statues/http://archive.is/aWxSQ,mtrue," Removal of a number of statues and other smaller Catholic icons from the campus of San Domenico School in San Anselmo has raised concerns among some parents.    In an email to the schools board of directors, Dominican Sisters of San Rafael and the head of school, Shannon Fitzpatrick objected to the removal of the statues and other steps the school has taken in an effort to make the school more inclusive.    Articulating an inclusive foundation appears to mean letting go of San Domenicos 167-year tradition as a Dominican Catholic school and being both afraid and ashamed to celebrate ones heritage and beliefs, wrote Fitzpatrick, whose 8-year-old son attends the school.    She added, In our time here, the word Catholic has been removed from the mission statement, sacraments were removed from the curriculum, the lower school curriculum was changed to world religions, the logo and colors were changed to be less Catholic, and the uniform was changed to be less Catholic.    Responding to follow-up questions Monday, Fitzpatrick wrote, There are other families having the same concerns I do. Many parents feel if the school is heading in a different direction then the San Domenico community should have been notified before the signing of the enrollment for the following year.    Cheryl Newell, who had four children graduate from San Domenico, said, I am extremely disappointed in the school and the direction theyve been going. This isnt a new thing that theyve been intentionally eroding their Catholic heritage. Theyre trying to be something for everyone and theyre making no one happy,    Ceremony    Kim Pipki, whose daughter left San Domenico two years ago after graduating from ninth grade, said some of the statues were also important to families who arent Catholic.    The one main statue that has everyone fired up is the baby Jesus and Mary one, Pipki said. It was at the center of the primary school courtyard.    Pipki said the school had a ceremony during which children would place a crown on the statue of Mary.    It was less about God and more about passing on some traditions, Pipki said. People were shocked that the statues were pitched in the basement.    Amy Skewes-Cox, who heads San Domenico Schools board of trustees, said the relocation and removal of some of the schools 180 religious icons was completely in compliance with San Domenicos new strategic plan, approved unanimously by the board of trustees and the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael last year. She said at least 18 icons remain, including a statue of St. Dominic at the center of the campus.    Advertisement    She noted that it was unfortunate the removal of the statues occurred at about the same time as the unrest in Charlottesville over the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and that the issues are totally different and have absolutely no connection other than it is change, and people have a hard time with change.    All faiths    Sister Maureen McInerney, prioress general of the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael, said she hadnt visited the campus lately and was under the impression statues had been relocated on campus rather than removed entirely.    I try not to get into the details of the operation. That really isnt my place, McInerney said. So if there has been a reduction in the number of statues but there are still many statues around the campus, I think that would be fine.    San Domenico is a Catholic school; it also welcomes people of all faiths, McInerney said. It is making an effort to be inclusive of all faiths.    One of the strategic plans stated goals is to strengthen San Domenicos identity as an independent school and clearly articulate its inclusive spiritual foundation.    San Domenico was founded by the Dominican Sisters in 1850 as an independent, Catholic school meaning that it is not owned or operated by a parish or religious order.    San Domenico is both a Catholic school and an independent school, said Head of School Cecily Stock, but what we were finding after doing some research is that in the broader community we are known as being a Catholic school and are not necessarily known as an independent school. We want to make sure that prospective families are aware that we are an independent school.    No catechism    Of the 660 students who attend the K-12 school, 121 are boarding students and 98 of these are international students from British Columbia, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Mexico, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam. The students attending San Domenico come from a variety of religious backgrounds besides Christianity: Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam.    Stock said schools operated by the Catholic Church, such as St. Isabella, Marin Catholic and St. Anselm, tend to have larger class sizes and lower tuition costs. Tuition for an incoming kindergarten student at San Domenico is $29,850.    Skewes-Cox said, If you walk on the campus and the first thing you confront is three or four statues of St. Dominic or St. Francis, it could be alienating for that other religion, and we didnt want to further that feeling.    Stock said the parents of some prospective students who visited the campus expressed concern about this.    In her email to the school, Fitzpatrick wrote that she became concerned with the direction of San Domenico when it removed first reconciliation and first communion from the second-grade curriculum, last year.    Stock said the year before last the school began offering catechism after school and then last year phased it out entirely.    We had very few families interested. I think last year it was fewer than five, Stock said. It just made sense to have the students prepare for communion with their local parishes where they would be with a larger group of students.    Stock said, Over the last few years weve had fewer Catholic students as part of the community and a larger number of students of various faith traditions. Right now about 80 percent of our families do not identify as Catholic.    World religions    Rather than indoctrinate students in Catholic theology, San Domenico provides students with instruction in world religions and philosophy.    Its really about empowering each student and giving them the information so they can discover their own purpose, their own truth, Stock said. We believe the best way to understand your own faith is to learn about the faiths of others.    Mirza Khan, the schools director of philosophy, ethics and world religions, said, The Dominican teaching philosophy is not to teach there is only one truth. It is to foster conversation, to intentionally invite in participants that have different perspectives in a very open-ended process of philosophical and spiritual inquiry. That has been a long-standing part of the Dominican tradition.    Khan, whose father and grandfather were Sufi teachers in India, received a bachelors degree in comparative religion at Bard College. Before becoming a teacher at San Domenico about 10 years ago, he worked as a research assistant to a professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.    Khan said during his time in Jerusalem he got to see first-hand how devastating it can be when religions are in conflict.

Earlier this week the Planned Parenthood abortion business affiliate in Indiana and Kentucky posted a promotional code its supporters could use to request that Chilis donate 15% of the pre-tax meal purchase to benefit the abortion corporation.    So according to the voucher, if you take this voucher to a Chilis restaurant in one of the listed locations, 15% of the cost of your order would go to fund Planned Parenthood.    How lovely.    This is not the first time that Chilis has been involved in potential donations to the Planned Parenthood abortion business. A Chilis restaurant in California initially set up a fundraiser for a local Planned Parenthood abortion clinic This is not the first time that Chilis has been involved in potential donations to the Planned Parenthood abortion business. A Chilis restaurant in California initially set up a fundraiser for a local Planned Parenthood abortion clinic but eventually cancelled it after pro-life advocates complained    California.    Of course.    According to a spokesperson for Chilis parent company, Brinker International, Inc., The event was canceled after hearing growing concerns from our guests. Management of the Natomas Chilis received numerous calls, as the Sacramento community expressed concerns about Chilis restaurant donating money to Planned Parenthood, which performs over 330,000 abortions every year. Wynette Sills, a local pro-life advocate who had been monitoring the situation, told LifeNews today, The Chilis fundraiser for Planned Parenthood was brought to my attention the night before the event. By the next morning, Chilis decided to cancel the Planned Parenthood fundraiser due to guest complaints.    So the event was cancelled, in that instance, but the Chilis Truxel Road location felt they should do something to try and prevent any nasty litigation from Planned Parenthood, so they tossed them a $200 donation.    That was about $201 too much.

And youve got the right person in Bob Mueller to lead it.    The reason one former FBI director dubs his predecessor the right person for the role of special counsel makes him precisely the wrong person for the job, a former assistant FBI director tells Breitbart News.    advertisement    Bob Mueller and Jim Comey are the best of friends and have been for over two decades, James Kallstrom, former head of the bureaus New York office, explains. How do you appoint a special counsel who is a longtime friend? Its a massive conflict of interest.    In an investigation where Comey not only serves as the presidents main antagonist but in which the FBI figures to factor in to the findings, why would Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appoint the former director of the FBI to investigate a matter so heavily pertaining to the credibility of the organization Mueller once led?    It huge conflict of interest to ask him to look into the FBI, former assistant FBI director Kallstrom tells Breitbart News. Even if Mueller and Comey did not enjoy such a close personal relationship the idea of one FBI director investigating another seems like a stretch, critics contend.    The appointment of a special counsel raises the question of whether the appointment of his close friend came as a coincidence or if Comey helped engineer Muellers appointment the way he admits to helping to spur the creation of a special counsel through a calculated leak to the New York Times.    Garrett Graff, who authored a book on Mueller, reported on the investigator and the investigateds friendship long before Trump even entered politics. He explained in the Washingtonian four years ago of Comey that there was only one person in government whom he could confide in and trust: Bob Mueller. Graff wrote at Politico almost a month ago of the pairs close friendship, with the younger man regarding the senior man as his mentor.    In the 2013 Washingtonian piece, Graff noted:    The two men are deeply alike, sharing a background and core principles. Both educated at Virginia universities with a strong public service tradition (Mueller at the University of Virginia; Comey at William &amp; Mary). They both achieved early success in the Justice Department and found subsequent life at private law firms lucrative but unfulfilling. Just years apart in the 1990s, they both gave up their top-tier private law firm jobs to return to the trenches of prosecuting criminalsMueller as a junior prosecutor in Washington, DC, and Comey in Richmond, Virginia. Both men were rising stars mentored and guided by Eric Holder in the 1990s during Holders time in the Justice Department under the Clinton administration.    Now, decades removed from their paths first crossing in the nations capital, their careers again dovetail. And observers wonder if this latest intersection comes as a coincidence.

Sen. David Perdue, a freshman senator from Georgia, opened his remarks at the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalitions Road to Majority conference by encouraging attendees to pray for President Obama. But, he added in a joking tone, they need to pray for him in a very specific way: We should pray for him like Psalms 109:8 says: Let his days be few, and let another have his office, the senator said, smiling wryly.    The crowd chuckled and he moved on with his address.    The rest of that passage, which Perdue did not recite, reads, May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow. May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven from their ruined homes.    The psalm is a pointed, lengthy death wish for one of Davids enemies.    Let the creditor seize all that he has, and let strangers plunder his labor. Let there be none to extend mercy to him, nor let there be any to favor his fatherless children. Let his posterity be cut off, and in the generation following let their name be blotted out, it continues.    Perdues joke drew immediate criticism. Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, tweeted, Republican Senator David Perdue is praying for President Obama to die. This is why Trump is the GOP nominee.    As the Washington Posts Dave Weigel pointed out, conservatives have long invoked this verse in the yearning for an end to Obamas days in office. A Christian Science Monitor report from November 16, 2009, detailed the popularity of bumper stickers that read simply, Pray for Obama: Psalm 109:8.    Its protected speech, but its clearly offensive, the Anti-Defamation Leagues Deborah Lauter said at the time.    The Road to Majority conference brings together top leaders in the social-conservative world, as well as prominent elected Republicans. Shortly after Perdues speech, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and top Trump adviser Sen. Jeff Sessions spoke. Donald Trump will keynote the event later today.    UPDATE: After publication, Perdue spokeswoman Caroline Vanvick gave this statement to Bloombergs Sahil Kapur:    Senator Perdue said we are called to pray for our country, for our leaders, and for our president. He in no way wishes harm towards our president and everyone in the room understood that. However, we should add the media to our prayer list because they are pushing a narrative to create controversy and that is exactly what the American people are tired of. ",Sen.

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time theres been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern, said Dr. Polowotski. Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it, said Bob. We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think, he said.

She doesnt like to be touched by strangers. OK, no sweaty handshakes. Fair enough. But theres more. If you get nervous around Roseanne, try not to show it. Shes like a shark. If she smells fear, shell tear you apart, the makeup artist says.    As I wait for Barr to arrive, I contemplate the pop culture folklore that surrounds her: the alleged multiple personality disorder, the roller coaster relationship with Tom Arnoldwhich culminated in a bitter divorcethe theory (her own) that she may in fact be the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, whom she has requested to be dressed as for her Heeb photo shoot. Nervous doesnt begin to describe my feelings about meeting this 54 Jewish grandmother.    With her hit sitcom off the air for more than a decade and the tabloid pages of her tumultuous life rotting in landfills, Barr currently spends her time working on a collection of essays on menopause, celebrity, pharmaceuticals and Jewish life in Mormon Utah (to be published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment) and disseminating her signature mix of insights and insults through her blog (Roseanneworld.com). She briefly kept an account with what she now calls that shit heap (Twitter) before deleting it, citing as her reason the idiocy of people and how ill-informed they all seem. Today, when she brusquely enters the photo studio, she seems none too happy about having been dragged from her self-imposed exile.    Hello, she barks in a general greeting to everyone and no one. I approach with the kind of caution usually reserved for wild animals and salute her with a Sieg Heil in honor of our shoot. She looks at me blankly and asks, Who are you? I do my best to explain, then abruptly break the second Roseanne commandment: Sorry, Im a bit nervous, I stammer. The second the words are out of my mouth I brace myself for the onslaught, but to my surprise I seem to have amused her and Barr softens into the loving, if somewhat irritated, matriarch who charmed a generation.    As the Domestic Goddess dons the famous moustache, transforming into Domestic Goddess Hitler, I notice that shes beginning to have fun. She nails the Fuehrers facial expressions with twisted glee, and as she takes the burnt gingerbread Jew Cookies out of the oven it occurs to me that Barr may be the last celebrity utterly incapable of giving a fucka quality theoretically easy to embody until its time to face the practical repercussions. Franklin Ajae, Paul Mooney, Mort Sahl and Dick Gregorys passings will tear my kishkas out, Barr laments. They gave everything they had to just tell the truth, and they couldnt make a decent living because of the choice they madenot selling out to Hollywood.    At 55 years old, truth is the key governing principal to Barr. Yes, she has plastic in her past, but she has since rejected the idea of staving off the aging process. In fact, clinging to youth now seems downright disgusting to her. Todays youth make me rejoice in being a germ-obsessed hermit, she confides. The thought of young people doing it is repulsive to me. However, this does not mean the lovable curmudgeon doesnt know how to party. I have the pleasure of drinking too much in my post-menopausal incarnation, she reveals. I like tequila, really expensive kinds straightup. I hate alcoholics and AA If you cant drink responsibly, dont drink at all. Dont go to meetings, whine about your character flaws and blame the fact that you are a sociopath on booze. Barr also supports legalizing marijuana and has plenty of theories on the subject. Kraft Foods invented pot. You have to realize that its a spiritual hunger, not a material hunger, that you are feeling, she says.    As we wrap up the shoot, Barr puts her Swastika armband, one of the gingerbread victims and a Polaroid of herself in the costume in a Ziploc bag, making it look like evidence from some bizarre crime scene. She plans on bringing it to her 13-year-old son when she picks him up from school. Maybe this will make my kid like me, she says with a sigh.    When the photographer suggests that we pose together for a quick snapshot, I put my arm around this slightly eccentric drinker and pot smoker who gets off on dressing like a Nazi, and it dawns on me: I adore her. No-touching protocol be damned, I lean in to plant a kiss on her cheek, and, to my surprise, she turns toward me and puckers her lips.

A report released on Monday contains an email exchange between two senior officials at British-based contractor Britam Defence where a scheme 'approved by Washington' is outlined explaining that Qatar would fund rebel forces in Syria to use chemical weapons.    Barack Obama made it clear to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad last month that the U.S. would not tolerate Syria using chemical weapons against its own people.    Scroll down for video    War games: An explosion in the Syrian city of Homs last month. It has been now been suggested that the U.S. backed the use of chemical weapons to spur international military intervention    According to Infowars.com , the December 25 email was sent from Britam's Business Development Director David Goulding to company founder Philip Doughty.        It reads: 'Phil... Weve got a new offer. Its about Syria again. Qataris propose an attractive deal and swear that the idea is approved by Washington.    'Well have to deliver a CW to Homs, a Soviet origin g-shell from Libya similar to those that Assad should have.

A business networking profile for Phil Doughty lists him as Chief Operationg Officer for Britam, United Arab Emirates, Security and Investigations.    The U.S. State Department had not returned a request for comment on the alleged emails to MailOnline today at time of publication.        However the use of chemical warfare was raised at a press briefing in D.C. on January 28.

The document, revealed in The Cable , revealed the findings of an investigation by Scott Frederic Kilner, the U.S. consul general in Istanbul, into accusations that the Syrian army used chemical weapons in the December 23 attack.    An Obama administration official who had access to the document was reported as saying: 'We can't definitely say 100 per cent, but Syrian contacts made a compelling case that Agent 15 was used in Homs on Dec. 23.'    Mr Kilner's investigation included interviews with civilians, doctors, and rebels present during the attack, as well as the former general and head of the Syrian WMD program, Mustafa al-Sheikh.    Dr. Nashwan Abu Abdo, a neurologist in Homs, is certain chemical weapons were used. He told The Cable: 'It was a chemical weapon, we are sure of that, because tear gas can't cause the death of people.'    Threats: Barack Obama said during a speech last month that if Syria used chemical weapons against its own people it would be 'totally unacceptable'    Tyrant: Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, pictured with his wife Asma, is facing increasing international pressure over his brutal massacre of his own people    Eye witness accounts from the investigation revealed that a tank launched chemical weapons and caused people exposed to them to suffer nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, delirium, seizures, and respiratory distress.    The symptoms suggest that the weaponized compound Agent-15 was responsible. Syria denied using chemical weapons and said it would never use them against citizens.    Speaking to Pentagon reporters at the time, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said his biggest concern was how the U.S. and allies would secure the chemical and biological weapons sites scattered across Syria and ensure the components don't end up in the wrong hands if the regime falls, particularly under violent conditions.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/e-cigarettes-cancer-formaldehyde/https://archive.is/HI73G,mfalse," New research has found electronic cigarettes to contain even 10 times more cancer causing ingredients than the tobacco products they are supposed to save us from.    Quite an astonishing revelation given E-cigarettes are meant to replace a dangerous and life destroying habit.    E-cigarettes are used by millions of people worldwide, all with the belief that they are a safer alternative to tobacco products. However, according to research conducted by Japanese scientists, e-cigarettes contain 10 times the level of cancer-causing carcinogens than regular cigarettes.    In the research commissioned by the Japanese Ministry of Health, it was found that formaldehyde and acetaldehyde carcinogens are present, and prevalent, in the liquid produced by many e-cigarette products. Furthermore, it was determined that e-cigarettes can fuel potentially life-threatening drug-resistant pathogens. This discovery comes from a lab study that tested the vapor from e-cigarettes on live methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and human cells. According to a Japanese Ministry of Health official, the formaldehyde carcinogen is much more present in the e-cigarette liquids than in the chemicals used in regular cigarettes. In one brand of e-cigarette the team found more than 10 times the level of carcinogens contained in one regular cigarette. Especially when the wire (which vaporizes the liquid) gets overheated, higher amounts of those harmful substances seemed to be produced, said researcher Naoki Kunugita. Kunugita also added that the levels of the formaldehyde carcinogen varied in the final results. You call them e-cigarettes, but they are products totally different from regular tobacco. The government is now studying the possible risks associated with them, with view to looking at how they should be regulated. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised governments to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to underage people because they posed potentially serious health risks. The UN health agency said that although theres a lack of evidence regarding the damage caused by e-cigarettes, theres still enough evidence to caution children and adolescents, pregnant women, and women of reproductive age about their use. According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) more than a quarter of a million youth who had never smoked a cigarette used electronic cigarettes in 2013. This number reflects a three-fold increase, from about 79,000 in 2011, to more than 263,000 in 2013. What do you think of these findings?

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fbi-warned-about-white-supremacists/http://thegrio.com/2015/05/12/fbi-white-supremacists-law-enforcement/,mtrue," Because of intensifying civil strife over the recent killings of unarmed black men and boys, many Americans are wondering, Whats wrong with our police? Remarkably, one of the most compelling but unexplored explanations may rest with a FBI warning of October 2006, which reported that White supremacist infiltration of law enforcement represented a significant national threat.    Several key events preceded the report. A federal court found that members of a Los Angeles sheriffs department formed a Neo Nazi gang and habitually terrorized the black community. Later, the Chicago police department fired Jon Burge, a detective with reputed ties to the Ku Klux Klan, after discovering he tortured over 100 black male suspects. Thereafter, the Mayor of Cleveland discovered that many of the city police locker rooms were infested with White Power graffiti. Years later, a Texas sheriff department discovered that two of its deputies were recruiters for the Klan.    In near prophetic fashion, after the FBIs warning, white supremacy extremism in the U.S. increased, exponentially. From 2008 to 2014, the number of white supremacist groups, reportedly, grew from 149 to nearly a thousand, with no apparent abatement in their infiltration of law enforcement.    This year, alone, at least seven San Francisco law enforcement officers were suspended after an investigation revealed they exchanged numerous White Power communications laden with remarks about lynching African-Americans and burning crosses. Three reputed Klan members that served as correction officers were arrested for conspiring to murder a black inmate. At least four Fort Lauderdale police officers were fired after an investigation found that the officers fantasized about killing black suspects.    The United States doesnt publicly track white supremacists, so the full range of their objectives remains murky. Although black and Jewish-Americans are believed to be the foremost targets of white supremacists, recent attacks in Nevada, Wisconsin, Arizona, Kansas and North Carolina, demonstrate that other non-whites, and religious and social minorities, are also vulnerable. Perhaps more alarmingly, in the last several years alone, white supremacists have reportedly murdered law enforcement officers in Arkansas, Nevada and Wisconsin.    In fact, the FBI reports that of the 511 law enforcement officers killed during felony incidents from 2004 to 2013, white citizens killed the majority of them. Of the citizens stopped by law enforcement officers in New York City and Chicago, white citizens were more likely to be found with guns and drugs. Given the white supremacist penchant for violence, guns and drug trafficking, the findings may be an indication that their network is just as destructive and far-reaching as that of foreign terrorist groups.    The unfortunate consequence of todays threat is that a law enforcement officer may be good or bad, a villain or hero; one exceptionally prone to exhibit malicious forms of racial hatred, or distinctively suited to protect the racially oppressed. But the paradox doesnt end there.    The white supremacist threat brings to light a dark feature of the American experience that some believed extinct. It rouses ingrained notions of distrusts between police and communities of color while bringing to bear the vital interest citizens of good will share in the complete abolishment of race as a judgmental factor.    As the nation struggles to resolve the perplexities of police brutality, the white supremacist threat should inform all Americans that todays civil discord is not borne out of a robust animosity towards law enforcement, most of whom are professional. Rather, its more representative of a centuries-old ideological clash, which has ignited in citizens of good will a desire to affirm notions of racial equality so that the moral ethos of American culture is a reality for all.

They were so tall, wide and very power full that they were able to pull out big trees just with the one hand.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/greenpeace-activist-get-arm-bitten-off-hugging-white-shark/https://archive.is/Mg9Ac,ffalse," An environmental activist was almost killed Yesterday in the Indian Ocean, after the great white shark he was trying to hug suddenly attacked him and bit his arm off.    21-year old Darrell Waterford, from Eugene in Oregon, was participating in a promotional video for Greenpeace, some 100 nautical miles away from the Australian city of Perth.    Along with four other members of the organization, Mr. Waterford decided to dive with some great white sharks in order to improve the marine predators public image and raise awareness about shark hunting.    The group shot some incredible footage during the first 30 minutes, as they swam with a group of sharks caressing and even hugging the large animals.    Unfortunately for the young American, one of the sharks suddenly became aggressive after being hugged and suddenly attacked him.    It attacked Mr. Waterford and tore off his right arm right below the elbow. The young man lost a large amount of blood, but was able to get out of the water and was rapidly taken to the hospital.    Huei Li Chong, the leader of the expedition, described the violent attack in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.    The shark seemed really friendly at first, but then it went totally berserk. It charged Darrell and bit off his hand in an instant, so we all hurried out of the water before it killed us.    According to him, the shark might have turned aggressive after smelling blood in the water.    Sharks can be affectionate an cuddly when theyre calm, but the smell of blood activates their predator instincts. Its not their fault, and we shouldnt hold them responsible.    Huei Li Chong, who was diving with Mr. Waterford at the time of the attack, believes the shark may have become aggressive after smelling blood.    Greenpeace has been campaigning for years against shark finning, which consists of the removal of fins from sharks, often while the shark is alive.    Despite the organizations efforts, finning has increased dramatically since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for shark fin soup and traditional cures.    Greenpeace has been trying for years to improve the white sharks image in order to obtain an international ban, similar to the international treaty that applies to commercial whaling.    Several members of the organization now fear that this incident will compromise their campaign to restore the white sharks image as a peaceful marine creature.    .

Her phone rang about 8 p.m. It was the chef at the Red Hen, the tiny farm-to-table restaurant that she co-owned just off Main Street in the small city of Lexington, in the western part of Virginia.    Sarah Huckabee Sanders had just walked in and sat down, the chef informed her.    He said the staff is a little concerned. What should we do? Wilkinson told The Washington Post. I said Id be down to see if its true.    It seemed unlikely to her that President Trumps press secretary should be dining at a 26-seat restaurant in rural Virginia. But then, it was unlikely that her entire staff would have misidentified Sanders, who had arrived last to a table of eight booked under her husbands name.    [Be careful what you wish for Max!: Trump takes aim at Waters after she calls for public harassment of his Cabinet]    As she made the short drive to the Red Hen, Wilkinson knew only this:    She knew Lexington, population 7,000, had voted overwhelmingly against Trump in a county that voted overwhelmingly for him. She knew the community was deeply divided over such issues as Confederate flags. She knew, she said, that her restaurant and its half-dozen servers and cooks had managed to stay in business for 10 years by keeping politics off the menu.    And she knew she believed that Sarah Huckabee Sanders worked in the service of an inhumane and unethical administration. That she publicly defended the presidents cruelest policies, and that that could not stand.    Im not a huge fan of confrontation, Wilkinson said. I have a business, and I want the business to thrive. This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.        Sarah Huckabee Sanders arrives at a media briefing at the White House. (Getty Images)    When she walked into the restaurant, Wilkinson saw that there had been no mistake. The Red Hen is no bigger than some apartments, and the group table was impossible to miss: Sanders in a black dress, her husband, three or four men and women of roughly similar ages, and an older couple.    They had cheese boards in front of them, Wilkinson said. Like any other family. The kitchen was already preparing the partys main course. Wilkinson interrupted to huddle with her workers.    Several Red Hen employees are gay, she said. They knew Sanders had defended Trumps desire to bar transgender people from the military. This month, they had all watched her evade questions and defend a Trump policy that caused migrant children to be separated from their parents.    Tell me what you want me to do. I can ask her to leave, Wilkinson told her staff, she said. They said yes.     It was important to Wilkinson, she said, that Sanders had already been served that her staff had not simply refused her on sight. And it was important to her that Sanders was a public official, not just a customer with whom she disagreed, many of whom were included in her regular clientele.    All the same, she was tense as she walked up to the press secretarys chair.    I said, Im the owner, she recalled, Id like you to come out to the patio with me for a word.     They stepped outside, into another small enclosure, but at least out of the crowded restaurant.    I was babbling a little, but I got my point across in a polite and direct fashion, Wilkinson said. I explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion, and cooperation.    I said, Id like to ask you to leave.     Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington, VA to leave because I work for @POTUS and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) June 23, 2018    Wilkinson didnt know how Sanders would react, or whether Trumps chief spokeswoman had been called out in a restaurant before as the presidents homeland security secretary had been days earlier.    Sanderss response was immediate, Wilkinson said: Thats fine. Ill go.     [With Moscow Muellers and other promos, D.C. businesses bank on Trump themes]    Sanders went back to the table, picked up her things and walked out. The others at her table had been welcome to stay, Wilkinson said. But they didnt, so the servers cleared away the cheese plates and glasses.    They offered to pay, Wilkinson said. I said, No. Its on the house.     At the end of the shift, Wilkinson said, staff members left the usual overnight note in the kitchen for the morning manager: a problem with the credit-card machine. Restock vodka and tequila.    If youve ever heard the term to 86 someone, it comes from the restaurant industry code to refuse service, or alternatively to take an item off the menu.    86 Sara Huckabee Sanders, read the note, below the reminder to buy more Pellegrino.    _EMAIL_ got kicked out of the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Va tonight. Apparently the owner didnt want to serve her and her party out of moral conviction. pic.twitter.com/jr3bfiY3XY Brennan Gilmore (@brennanmgilmore) June 23, 2018    One of the servers photographed the whiteboard before going home Friday. He had posted it to his public Facebook wall by the time Wilkinson woke up Saturday.    For all the angst that evening, Wilkinson said, everything had taken place with decorum. She had been polite; Sanders had been polite; the press secretarys family had been polite as they followed her out the door.    Not so much the rest of the world, as it discovered Red Hen waiter Jaike Foley-Schultzs Facebook post: I just served Sarah huckabee sanders for a total of 2 minutes before my owner asked her to leave.    A fountain of alternately celebratory and outraged comments gushed from Foley-Schultzs Facebook wall into the Red Hens social media accounts, then its Yelp review page.    [The chaotic effort to reunite immigrant parents with their separated kids]    Five stars: Thank you for refusing to serve a person who lies to the American people for a living.    One star: They made some snide remark about a spit souffle for the Florida nazi.    Between the fury and fawning of thousands who almost certainly had not eaten at the restaurant, the Red Hens Yelp reviews almost instantly averaged out to two-and-a-half stars. Another Red Hen in the District was at pains to make clear that it had no affiliation with Wilkinsons place.    And that was before Sanders confirmed the story in a Saturday-morning tweet, including the restaurants name and location.    I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so, the press secretary wrote. Her actions say far more about her than about me.    On Monday, her boss weighed in:    The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018    Wilkinson had no regrets about her decision.    I would have done the same thing again, she said Saturday. We just felt there are moments in time when people need to live their convictions. This appeared to be one.    As she headed out the door to a weekend Main Street festival she had helped organize, she sounded hopeful that the Red Hen could open for business as usual Saturday night. Yes, she had seen calls for #MAGA protests on Facebook. But this is a small enough town, and were known, she said optimistically. This is not going to be a giant surprise to anyone.    The day brought surprises of its own.    By Saturday afternoon, reporters and photographers loitered outside the restaurant, as did people who had wandered over to gawk.    Boo, Red Hen! and Yay, Trump! were shouted, alternately, from the windows of passing cars. A Lexington resident had brought by a bouquet of flowers and a hand-lettered sign that read, Democracy requires principled govt. Thank you Red Hen!!    Meanwhile, Stephen Russek of Natural Bridge, Va., told a reporter: Im not crazy about everything Donald Trump does, but what they did to that woman in this restaurant is disgraceful.    Chris Roessler, would-be customer, stood outside in confusion. He and his wife had booked an evening reservation, and just received an email canceling it.    We would like to avoid exposing our patrons to any potential unpleasantness from outside entities, Red Hen management had written around the same time that fans of President Trump were doing their best to troll the restaurants phone line with fake reservations.    Unaware of the Sanders incident, Roessler said, he had walked to the restaurant to ask for answers, but no one would open the door.    [The latest sign of political divide: Shaming and shunning public officials]    Over the next two days, a backlash against the Red Hen grew in intensity, eventually reaching the White House.    On Monday, Sanders opened her statement in the White House briefing room by speaking about the incident and the numerous aftershocks that came in its wake, including harassment directed toward the restaurant and others with the same name, and remarks made by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters who urged people to confront Trump administration officials in public.    We are allowed to disagree but we should be able to do so freely and without fear of harm, Sanders said. Healthy debate on ideas and political philosophy is important. But the calls for harassment and the push for any Trump supporter to avoid the public is unacceptable.    Sanders, who was criticized over the weekend by some former federal officials who said they believed the use of her official Twitter account to chastise the restaurant violated federal ethics rules, said she had tweeted about it after being contacted by more than a dozen reporters.    It was considered news of the day, so I responded in the way I would for any other news of the day story, she said.    The public debate has also continued about the appropriateness of the restaurants actions. The Washington Posts editorial board wrote that while Trumps behavior in office might be terrible, officials who work for him should be allowed to eat dinner in peace.    Those who are insisting that we are in a special moment justifying incivility should think for a moment how many Americans might find their own special moment, the board wrote.    Far-right personalities passed around Wilkinsons home address and phone number on social media.    Go after her children [] and husband [] just like the leftist do to Trump employees, a commenter wrote beneath a law professors article criticizing the restaurateur.    Sanderss father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, described the episode as bigotry, while Ben Cline, a Republican Virginia lawmaker, called Wilkinson a liberal New York transplant. (She is originally from New York, but has owned a house in Lexington since at least 1996.)    And a conspiracy theorist (who also believes Bill Clinton rose to power with the help of Haitian black magic priests) speculated in a viral Twitter thread that Wilkinson could be responsible for every unsolved child abduction in Virginia.    An unaffiliated Red Hen restaurant hundreds of miles away was egged overnight, according to Fox 5 DC. Sanderss supporters have reportedly even raged against the Olde Ren Hen in Ontario, Canada, in a misdirected attempt to punish the Lexington restaurant whose phone lines have been down since the weekend.    [Did the Red Hen violate Sarah Huckabee Sanderss rights when it kicked her out?]    And if the furor showed any sign of dying down after three days, President Trump reignited it on Monday when he tweeted, based on photographs of the buildings exterior, that the Red Hen was likely unsanitary.    They will be conveniently and coincidently audited a few times by the IRS and I wouldnt be surprised if they meet some stiff fines or jail time for tax fraud, a commenter on the far-right /pol/ message board wrote after seeing Trumps tweet.    Not to mention if the county health inspector is a conservative, added another.    By Monday afternoon, Wilkinsons personal voice mail was full, her business line was not accepting calls, and someone had redirected the Red Hens website to what appeared to be a Japanese-language automotive blog.

However, after speaking to her daughters teacher, she realized the statement was accurate.    The teacher said she cant. She has to say yes. She has to accept and I said, 'Excuse me, Richard tells Fox 13.    Richard took her concerns to the school principal.    He basically just said theyve had this dance set up this way for a long time and theyve never had any concern before, she said of his response.    Lane Findlay with the Weber School District confirms its a rule, but he said its meant to teach students how to be inclusive.    Please be respectful, be polite,"" Findlay said. ""We want to promote kindness, and so we want you to say yes when someone asks you to dance.""    I do see it from their perspective when it comes to that, but there are many other ways to teach children how to be accepting than with a social dance, Richard counters.    Richard says forcing students not to say no teaches them the wrong lesson.    Sends a bad message to girls that girls have to say 'yes'; sends a bad message to boys that girls cant say 'no,'"" Richard said.    Prior to the dance, which is voluntary, students are told to fill out a card by selecting five people they want to dance with. The administration says if theres someone on the card you feel uncomfortable with, the student is encouraged to speak up.    If there is an issue, if theres students that are uncomfortable or have a problem with another student, I mean: thats certainly something that can be addressed with that student and parents, Findlay said.    However, Richard says rejection is part of life and at the end of the day, this policy is sending impressionable children the wrong message.    Psychologically, my daughter keeps coming to me and saying I cant say 'no' to a boy,"" she said. ""Thats the message kids are getting.""    One of the concerns that Richard addressed with the principal at Kanesville Elementary is that parents werent aware of this policy. She recommended he send out a permission slip, detailing the instructions given to students, and he agreed. As of now, the rule remains in place.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/letter-from-an-airline-pilot/http://acaptainslog.blogspot.com/2008/07/fallen-soldier_04.html,ftrue," Another 4th of July is here and all across the nation, millions of us will celebrate in thousands of different ways. Our military members around the world will miss out on hometown celebrations, instead, performing the duties assigned to them. This story is in honor of them.    As a commercial pilot, I too see the effects of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Last month I showed up to start a trip and was approached by a gate agent. Captain, good morning, I wanted to inform you that we have H.R. on this flight, she said. H.R. stands for human remains. Are they military?, I asked. Yes, she said. Is there and escort?, I asked. Yes, I already assigned him a seat, she said. Would you please tell him to come to the flight deck, you can board him early, I said.    A short while later, a young army sergeant entered the flight deck. He was the image of the perfectly dressed soldier. He introduced himself and I asked him about his soldier. The escorts of these fallen soldiers talk about them as if they are still alive and with us. My soldier is on his way back to Virginia, he said. He proceeded to answer my questions, but offered no words on his own. I asked him if there was anything I could do for him and he said no. I told him that he has the toughest job in the military and that I appreciated the work that he does for the families of our fallen soldiers. The first officer and I got up out of our seats to shake his hand. He left the flight deck to find his seat.    We completed our preflight checks, pushed back and performed an uneventful departure. About 30 minutes into our flight I received a call from the lead flight attendant in the cabin. I just found out the family of the soldier we are carrying, is onboard, he said. He then proceeded to tell me that the father, mother, wife and 2-year-old daughter were escorting their son, husband, and father home. The family was upset because they were unable to see the container that the soldier was in before we left. We were on our way to a major hub at which the family was going to wait 4 hours for the connecting flight home to Virginia. The father of the soldier told the flight attendant that knowing his son was below him in the cargo compartment and being unable to see him was too much for him and the family to bare. He had asked the flight attendant if there was anything that could be done to allow them to see him upon our arrival. The family wanted to be outside by the cargo door to watch the soldier being taken off the airplane. I could hear the desperation in the flight attendants voice when he asked me if there was anything I could do. Im on it, I said. I told him that I would get back to him.    Airborne communication with my company normally occurs in the form of email like messages. I decided to bypass this system and contact my flight dispatcher directly on a secondary radio. There is a radio operator in the operations control center who connects you to the telephone of the dispatcher. I was in direct contact with the dispatcher. I explained the situation I had onboard with the family and what it was the family wanted. He said he understood and that he would get back to me.    Two hours went by and I had not heard from the dispatcher. We were going to get busy soon and I needed to know what to tell the family. I sent a text message asking for an update. I saved the return message from the dispatcher and this following is the text.    Captain, sorry it has taken so long to get back to you. There is policy on this now and I had to check on a few things. Upon your arrival a dedicated escort team will meet the aircraft. The team will escort the family to the ramp and planeside. A van will be used to load the remains with a secondary van for the family. The family will be taken to their departure area and escorted into the terminal where the remains can be seen on the ramp. It is a private area for the family only. When the connecting aircraft arrives, the family will be escorted onto the ramp and planeside to watch the remains being loaded for the final leg home. Captain, most of us here in flight control are veterans. Please pass our condolences on to the family, thanks.    I sent a message back telling flight control thanks for a good job. I printed out the message and gave it to the lead flight attendant to pass on to the father. The lead flight attendant was very thankful and told me, You have no idea how much this will mean to them. Things started getting busy for the descent, approach and landing.    After landing, we cleared the runway and taxied to the ramp area. The ramp is huge with 15 gates on either side of the alleyway. It is always a busy area with aircraft maneuvering every which way to enter and exit. When we entered the ramp and checked in with the ramp controller, we were told that all traffic was being held for us. There is a team in place to meet the aircraft, we were told. It looked like it was all coming together, then I realized that once we turned the seat belt sign off, everyone would stand up at once and delay the family from getting off the airplane. As we approached our gate, I asked the copilot to tell the ramp controller we were going to stop short of the gate to make an announcement to the passengers. He did that and the ramp controller said, Take your time.    I stopped the aircraft and set the parking brake. I pushed the public address button and said, Ladies and gentleman, this is your captain speaking. I have stopped short of our gate to make a special announcement. We have a passenger on board who deserves our honor and respect. His name is private XXXXXX, a soldier who recently lost his life. Private XXXXXX is under your feet in the cargo hold. Escorting him today is army sergeant XXXXXXX. Also onboard are his father, mother, wife, and daughter. Your entire flight crew is asking for all passengers to remain in their seats to allow the family to exit the aircraft first. Thank you.    We continued the turn to the gate, came to a stop and started our shutdown procedures. A couple of minutes later I opened the cockpit door. I found the two forward flight attendants crying, something you just do not see. I was told that after we came to a stop, every passenger on the aircraft stayed in their seats, waiting for the family to exit the aircraft. When the family got up and gathered their things, a passenger slowly started to clap their hands. Moments later more passengers joined in and soon the entire aircraft was clapping. Words of God Bless You, Im sorry, Thank you, Be proud, and other kind words were uttered to the family as they made their way down the aisle and out of the airplane. They were escorted down to the ramp to finally be with the loved one lost.    I never did see the family. Another soldier died, another family grieved and we did what we could. That is the way it works sometimes. I get a call from the cabin and we work as a team to do what we can. That day everybody from the flight crew, to the operations center, to the 184 passengers onboard, we did what we could. Many of the passengers disembarking thanked me for the announcement I made. They were just words, I could say them over and over again, but nothing I say will bring that soldier back. I respectfully ask that all of you reflect on this day and the sacrifices that millions of men and women have made to ensure our freedom, safety, and the right to live a good life.

The American flag is a symbol of good because it showed the uniting of colonies and the beginning of the United States of America. However there are symbols of bad times, like the Nazi flag. No matter what side they are on, they represent some sort of historical significance.    One of these flags that represents human history is the confederate flag. Now as we all know the Confederate flag is an important part of American history. And yet we flash back to last summer when people were offended by the flag and demanded that it get taken down. Ever since then, the flags have been disappearing, despite the fact that they are part of the history of this great land. And because of that, it seems that the Department of Justice has found a new way to determine who is racist and who isnt.    Two men were arrested for beating up an African American man and charged with a hate crime. Going through their Facebook feed, it is pretty easy to see how they are racist. They had pictures of Adolf Hitler, the KKK, and other various white power symbols. But the one thing that the DOJ did include that shouldnt be included was pictures of the Confederate Flag.    Now yes, these men were absolutely 100% racist. But just because they had a picture of the Confederate flag doesnt mean that. It was the pictures of Hitler and other symbols of white power that indicate they were racist.    If the DOJ is going to start using Confederate flags to determine if someone is racist or not, then there is suddenly going to be a lot more racist people. Despite the fact that the flag is of HISTORICAL significance to the nation.    Despite what these social justice warriors think, the flag is not a racist symbol anymore. It is literally a historical object. It is also part of this history of this country. So it sounds like they are trying to get rid of all the bad parts of history, despite the fact that its necessary to learn about them.    But wouldnt it be interesting if they tried to ban something else from history, like the black panther salute? I really wonder how people would react to that.

Doctors said users have been taken to hospital after suffering extreme bouts of scromiting which means they are screaming and vomiting at the same time.    This new word was invented by staff at emergency rooms across the US, who are seeing more and more people turn up yelling in pain and throwing up all over the place.    Its believed the scromiting is caused by a condition called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) which affects people who have consumed weed for a long period of time.    The illness is not properly understood, but its known that the only guaranteed way to stop it is for sufferers to give up smoking cannabis altogether. Some people also get temporary relief by taking a hot bath.     If you find yourself scromiting after too much weed, you might want to take a bath and think about giving up cannabis (Picture: Getty)    Chalfonte LeNee Queen, a 47-year-old from San Diego, has experienced this grim condition.    She said the pain was sometimes so bad that she ended up on the floor, retching and wracked with pain.    Ive cried out for my mom, whos been dead for 20 years, mentally not realizing she cant come to me.    The illness strikes users who have been smoking regularly for a long time, with one study suggesting people would need to consume cannabis between three and fives time a day to develop CHS.    The syndrome was first described in 2004 by Allen and colleagues and is characterized by chronic cannabis use, cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting, and the learned behaviour of hot bathing, doctors wrote.     Doctors have been stunned by the new condition, which appears to be becoming more common in America after the herb was legalised (Photo: AFP)    Its been suggested that CHS is caused by a build-up of cannabinoids in the body over a long period of time.    This may affect the function of cannabinoid receptors in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus which regulates the digestive system and body temperature.    The cannabis magazine High Times gave the following description of the illness : Often mistakenly called Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome, Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome is a rare form of cannabinoid toxicity that develops in chronic smokers.    Its characterized by cyclic episodes of debilitating nausea and vomiting. People who suffer from the syndrome often find that hot showers relieve their symptoms, and will compulsively bathe during episodes of nausea and vomiting. Symptoms stop after cessation of cannabis use. ","An increase in documented cases of people ""scromiting"" (screaming while vomiting) is linked to chronic heavy marijuana use.",test

A total of 109 subjects (56 PE and 53 controls) were included in this study. PE was defined as selfreported intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria and those who had had an IELT of &lt;2 min was considered as PE. All participants were evaluated using premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The vitamin 12 levels were measured in all subjects. The mean age between the PE and controls was comparable (p = .084). Mean IIEF and BDI scores between the two groups did not statistically differ. The mean IELT values in the PE group were significantly lower than in the control group (p &lt; .0001). PE patients reported significantly lower vitamin B12 levels compared with the controls (213.14 vs. 265.89 ng ml1; p &lt; .001). The ROC analysis showed a significant correlation between the diagnosis of PE and lower vitamin B12 levels. This study has demonstrated that lower vitamin B12 levels are associated with the presence of PE. This work also shows a strong correlation between vitamin B12 levels and the PEDT scores as well as the IELT values. ",New research suggests that Marmite helps combat premature ejaculation.,test

After all the times that Trump has been attacked by the Democratic side of our society for saying that we need a wall on our Mexican border to stop illegals from getting into our country and destroying our economy, Obama just pulled the most hypocritical and pointless move of his career.    Obama just gave a gift of $75 MILLION to Mexico to provide material and equipment for the building of a border wall on Mexicos SOUTHERN border and to help cover the expense of training to help man the wall properly.    So basically he is helping Mexico to keep out illegals from central America because Mexico doesnt want them. Yet the Mexican President, Enrique Pea Nieto, says he will not pay for the border wall on the northern border of Mexico to keep them out of the U.S, and Obama somehow sees the logic in this?    Trump has and always will be right about the wall blocking Mexico and if Obama had wanted to help a country keep illegals out then maybe he should start in the country that he is President in. Then again Obama has given trillions of dollars away to other countries while we Americans still sit here struggling to pay simple bill like mortgages, medical, food, electricity, etc.    I guess he felt the need to stick it to us in a special kind of way before we unceremoniously drop him outside of the White House gates come January 2017.

Donald Trumps running mate is a dangerous Christian extremist who wants creationism taught in public schools and believes the government should pay for gay conversion therapy.    In addition, in 2015, as Governor of Indiana, Pence allowed an HIV outbreak to spread, choosing prayer over a clean needle exchange.    But perhaps one of the most idiotic claims made by Pence is that condoms are too modern, too liberal, and offer a poor defense against sexually transmitted infections and diseases.    Pences bizarre and unsubstantiated claims concerning condoms came in 2002, in response to then-Secretary of State Colin Powell saying in an MTV forum that sexually active young people should protect themselves with condoms.    At the time Powell said:    I think its important for young people, especially, to protect themselves from the possibility of acquiring any sexually transmitted disease, but especially to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS, which is a plague that is upon the face of the earth.    In an interview with CNN, while advocating for abstinence only sex education, Pence said Powells call for condom use could mislead millions of young people and put their lives at risk.    Pence told CNNs Wolf Blitzer that it was a sad day because Powell had suggested condoms over abstinence:    Well, Wolf, I think it was given the enormous stature that Colin Powell rightly has, not only in America but in the world community it was a sad day. I dont think any administration has had a worse day since boxers and briefs on MTV. And the truth is that Colin Powell had an opportunity here to reaffirm this presidents commitment to abstinence as the best choice for our young people, and he chose not to do that in the first instance, but and so I think its very sad. The other part is that, frankly, condoms are a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases, and in that sense, Wolf, this was the secretary of state may be inadvertently misleading millions of young people and endangering lives.    Pence then went on to suggest that condoms are too modern, and too liberal, for him:    The problem is it was too modern of an answer, Wolf. It was it truly was a modern, liberal answer to a problem that parents like me are facing all over America, and frankly, all over the world.    Of course Pence is wrong. His claim that condoms are a very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases is easy to debunk. The CDC reports:    when used consistently and correctly, condoms are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV infection and reduce the risk of other STDs.    As for condoms being too modern, reports indicate many ancient cultures used some form of condoms, and a famous cave painting in Dordogne, France, shows a man practicing safe sex circa 11,000 B.C.    In more contemporary times, rubber replaced animal intestines in condoms around the mid 1800s, and latex replaced rubber in the 1920s.    Needless to say, there is nothing modern about condoms.    Bottom line: Pence is an ignorant and dangerous religious extremist. By disseminating false and misleading information about condoms, Pence demonstrates that he is willing to endanger the health and welfare of young people in order to promote his demented, right-wing, conservative Christian, puritanical agenda.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/millions-of-muslims-marched-against-the-islamic-state/http://archive.is/fPscz,mfalse," Given the mainstream medias constant sensationalized reporting on terror and Muslims in the Western world, the utter lack of coverage of Arbaeens march on Sunday and Monday revealed the double standard that exists in reporting on peaceful Muslims.    Monday marked the final day of the mourning for Imam Hussein who was martyred in a battle with the massive army of Yazid after refusing allegiance to the tyrant caliph. Yazid the caliph of Umayyad dynasty was promoting the same type of Islam as ISIS and Wahhabist preach today.    Millions of marchers participated in the annual Arbaeen Procession in Karbala. The marchers are said to come from over 60 countries, and most of them have marched all the way to Karbala from other Iraqi cities like Najaf and Baghdad in a show of devotion. Each year, Sunni Muslims and followers of other religious groups such as Christians join the journey to mourn the martyrdom of Imam Hussein.    Arbaeen, or mourning, is a Shia Muslim tradition to mark the anniversary of seventh-century social justice leader Imam Husain.    Arbaeen is commemorated 40 days after Ashura, the martyrdom anniversary of Imam Hussein (AS) and his companions in 680 AD. However, in light of ISIS terror attacks globally, several people took the controversial step of turning their march political in order to denounce terror in all forms.    have been killed and displaced by ISISs declared caliphate, an exponentially larger number than those killed in attacks in the West. Tens of thousands of Muslims have been killed and displaced by ISISs declared caliphate, an exponentially larger number than those killed in attacks in the West.    The occasion has found additional significance in recent years as it has become a rallying cry for the campaign against ISIS terrorists who have frequently targeted the pilgrims.    Iraqi troops have been deployed to ensure security for the pilgrims. The northern and western parts of Iraq have been plagued by gruesome violence ever since ISIS terrorists began a campaign of terror in the country in June 2014.    The terrorist campaign, however, has not dissuaded pilgrims from around the world from making the journey.    It is noteworthy to mention the mainstream media blackout of the millions people marched gathering in war torn Iraq, battling the ISIS, as a clear sign of biased reporting.

This week, the states Republican-led senate passed the so-called Mississippi Church Protection Act which would militarize the states churches while also walking back gun regulations and stripping away oversight.    The bill would allow churches to create security programs and designate and train members to carry concealed weapons. It would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security. The bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a permit in Mississippi, expanding a measure passed last year that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse, satchel or briefcase, and another recent law that allows open carry in public. The bill also seeks to prohibit Mississippi officials from enforcing any federal agency regulations or executive orders that would violate the state constitution an attempt to federal gun restrictions not passed by Congress.    Mississippi church goers will now get to assign church members as security which can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death based on a designation of justifiable homicide the same legal standing that we afford police officers on duty.    What could go wrong?    Much of this baffling new legislation is in direct response to NRA lobbying directives to erode existing gun laws in order to create a polite society of heavily-armed citizens. Exploiting tragedy (and ignoring irony) the NRA has used recent mass shootings to push for more guns, not less. The narrative goes that if only churches would have access to firearms, shootings like the one in Charleston, South Carolina, could be prevented.    The premise, as tempting as it sounds for would-be vigilantes, has been thoroughly debunked both in theory and in practice. Data suggests that as the number of guns increase, the risk of someone being shot by those guns also increases. Places with a lot of good guys with guns tend to have higher incidences of gun injuries. Go figure. At the same time, anecdotal evidence supports these warnings as well. Weve seen that guns in churches often lead to disastrous accidents, while at the same time not once stopping a mass shooting in a house of worship.    With the removal of even permit requirements, Mississippi is planning on handing over the power of life and death to a bunch of untrained, untested amateurs who wont even have the risk of prosecution keeping their index finger off the trigger. A militarized church security unit assigned by the church, trained by the church, and meant to protect the church by any means necessary. If Mississippi legislators cant see the inherent danger in this as the bill heads to the House of Representatives to be finalized, then we are in a lot of trouble.

The 49-year-old Muslim migrant, identified only as Ghazia A., fled his Syrian homeland in 2015 and is now based in Montabaur, in the southwest German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.    SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER    According to a report in the German newspaper Das Bild, Ghazia traveled along the Balkan route through Turkey along with his wives and children and eventually reached Germany. When he applied for asylum, since polygamy is prohibited in Germany, he had to choose which of the four women to become his main wife, in order to ensure to all his children social benefits that the state provides to refugees.    Ghazia chose his wife Twasif as his official wife, along with the 5 children he had by her. According to German law, Ghazias other wives are classified as partners but the man insists that he treats them all equally.    According to our religion I have a duty to visit every family in the same way and do not prioritize any of them, Ghazia said, meaning that he often must leave home to visit his other wives, who all live within a 30-mile radius of the man. All of his 23 children but onea daughter now married and living in Saudi Arabiaare settled in Germany.    A local official in the town of Montabaur described Ghazias benefit situation as an exemption.    Ghazias story has provoked a strong reaction among many Germans, who are protesting the level of benefits enjoyed by the refugee.    The estimated sum of 360 thousand euros per year comes from a German financial manager who posted the figure on the website of the Association of Employers as an approximative calculation of what the German state would be paying for the whole family.    For his part, Ghazia claims he would like to work but his familial burdens make it impossible. Back in Syria the man reportedly earned enough money with his car sharing and car service business to cover the expenses of his large family.    Now he spends his time visiting his various families, he says.

Recent guidance (MILPER Message NR 97-095) emphasizes that requests under this provision will not be approved unless discharge is clearly in the best interests of the Army, not necessarily in the best interests of the soldier.

U.S. President Barack Obama shakes hands with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in a bilateral meeting before they both attend the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit later today in Seoul, South Korea, March 26, 2012. REUTERS/Larry Downing    Obama, during talks in Seoul, urged Moscow to give him space until after the November ballot, and Medvedev said he would relay the message to incoming Russian president Vladimir Putin.    The unusually frank exchange came as Obama and Medvedev huddled together on the eve of a global nuclear security summit in the South Korean capital, unaware their words were being picked up by microphones as reporters were led into the room.    U.S. plans for an anti-missile shield have bedeviled relations between Washington and Moscow despite Obamas reset in ties between the former Cold War foes. Obamas Republican opponents have accused him of being too open to concessions to Russia on the issue.    Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney seized on Obamas comment, calling it alarming and troubling.    This is no time for our president to be pulling his punches with the American people, Romney said in a campaign speech in San Diego.    As he was leaning toward Medvedev in Seoul, Obama was overheard asking for time - particularly with missile defense - until he is in a better position politically to resolve such issues.    I understand your message about space, replied Medvedev, who will hand over the presidency to Putin in May.    This is my last election ... After my election I have more flexibility, Obama said, expressing confidence that he would win a second term.    I will transmit this information to Vladimir, said Medvedev, Putins protg and long considered number two in Moscows power structure.    The exchange, parts of it inaudible, was monitored by a White House pool of television journalists as well as Russian reporters listening live from their press center.    The United States and NATO have offered Russia a role in the project to create an anti-ballistic shield which includes participation by Romania, Poland, Turkey and Spain.    But Moscow says it fears the system could weaken Russia by gaining the capability to shoot down the nuclear missiles it relies on as a deterrent.    It wants a legally binding pledge from the United States that Russias nuclear forces would not be targeted by the system and joint control of how it is used.    The White House, initially caught off-guard by questions about the leaders exchange, later released a statement recommitting to implementing missile defense which weve repeatedly said is not aimed at Russia but also acknowledging election-year obstacles on the issue.    Since 2012 is an election year in both countries, with an election and leadership transition in Russia and an election in the United States, it is clearly not a year in which we are going to achieve a breakthrough, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said.    Therefore, President Obama and President Medvedev agreed that it was best to instruct our technical experts to do the work of better understanding our respective positions, providing space for continued discussions on missile defense cooperation going forward, he said.

George Faught argues that rape and incest are the will of God while defending anti-abortion legislation.    Tuesday the Oklahoma House approved House Bill 1549, also called the Prenatal Nondiscrimination act of 2017. The controversial legislation would prohibit abortion when the fetus is diagnosed with Down syndrome or any other birth defect.    Discussing the legislation before Tuesdays vote, Faught, the bills author, said when it comes to abortion, people are being allowed to play God.    While discussing Faughts legislation on the House floor Rep. Regina Goodwin asked:    At what point did you decide that thats within your ability to decide for all women in Oklahoma?    Faught replied:    One of the things that I campaigned on was to protect life, and I believe life begins at conception.    At one point Rep. Cory Williams (D) asked Faught if rape is the will of God.    Faught responded:    Well, you know, if you read the Bible, theres actually a couple circumstances where that happened. The Lord uses all circumstances. I mean, you can go down that path, but its a reality unfortunately.    Williams followed up, asking if incest is the will of God.    Faught said:    Same answer. Doesnt deal with this bill.    Williams continued, asking why the bill does not include exceptions for rape and incest which are allowed in most anti-abortion legislation:    You wont make any exceptions for rape. You wont make any exceptions for incest, and you are proffering divine intervention as a reason why you wont do that.    Williams Continued:    I think it is very important (to know), do you believe rape and incest are actually the will of God?    After a brief pause, Faught replied:    You know its a great question to ask. And obviously if it happens in someones life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened, but so youre saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someones life and cant use anything and everything in someones life and I disagree with that.    Bottom line: For Rep. Faught, God is sovereign, and everything that happens is part of Gods plan even rape and incest. Sounds like Faughts God is a moral monster. Good thing God doesnt exist, but it is terrifying that legislators like Faught are making laws based on their ridiculous and dangerous religious superstitions.

The Pledge of Allegiance is no longer recited. Harvest festival has replaced Thanksgiving, and winter celebrations substitute for Christmas parties.    New principal Eujin Jaela Kim has given PS 169 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, a politically correct scrub-down, to the dismay of teachers and parents.    We definitely cant say Christmas, nothing with Christmas on it, nothing with Santa, PTA president Mimi Ferrer said administrators told her. No angels. We cant even have a star because it can represent a religious system, like the Star of David.    Kim, 33, did not return a call or email seeking comment.    A memo last month from assistant principal Jose Chaparro suggested a harvest festival instead of Thanksgiving or a winter celebration instead of a Christmas party. He urged staff to be sensitive of the diversity of our families. Not all children celebrate the same holidays.    Ninety-five percent of the 1,600 kids at PS 169 are Asian or Hispanic.    In a recent directive to all schools, the city Department of Education said it permits holiday symbols including Christmas trees, kinaras (candleholders for Kwanzaa), dreidels, Hanukkah menorahs and the Islamic star-and-crescent. Displays that depict images of deities, religious figures or religious texts are prohibited.    In a memo to staff this month, PS 169 business manager Johanna Bjorken added: In case you are wondering about grey areas: Santa Claus is considered an other religious figure.     But a DOE spokesman told The Post that Santa is allowed as a secular figure.    Santa was a part of the holidays at PS 169 for years. Joseph Iorio, a longtime assistant principal and the acting principal who preceded Kim, recalled state Assemblyman Felix Ortiz visiting the school dressed as Santa many times.    Iorio also said he tapped student leaders to lead the Pledge of Allegiance every Monday morning. When Kim arrived, the school-wide pledge ended.    A DOE spokesman said classrooms can recite the pledge at the teachers discretion. But PS 169 teachers said that Kim never told them they could do so.    Kim has other wacky priorities, school sources say. Soon after joining PS 169 in May 2014, her first time as a principal, she ordered the faculty to clear their classrooms of clutter. She moved hundreds of books and loads of supplies into the gym, where parents and other community members took what they wanted. The rest was tossed in the trash.    She also dumped boxes of newly purchased reading books in the basement because she preferred another curriculum, staffers said.    Kim bought seven 70- to 80-inch Sharp flat-screen smart TVs, which retail at about $3,000 each. After painting over and removing historic murals, she had the TVs mounted in the auditorium three over the stage and two on each side.    It was ridiculous, Ferrer said. They have never been used.    Kim holds a lottery for students to get academic assistance after school or on Saturdays. She also started a professional learning period in which teachers observe each other in class, but it eliminates one period of core instruction a week for students, staffers said.    Kim recently told staff that Chancellor Carmen Faria praised PS 169 at a town hall meeting. ","PS 169 Principal Eujin Jaela Kim banned the Pledge of Allegiance, Santa, and Thanksgiving.",test
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sanders-civil-rights-photos/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/02/11/stop-sending-around-this-photo-of-bernie-sanders/,ftrue," Update: Ive heard conflicting testimonies from Danny Lyon, the photographer, and Randy Ross, Bruce Rappaports ex-wife.    In trying to establish the civil rights bona fides of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), many of his supporters have taken to posting a black-and-white photo of the presidential candidate from 1962. Students can be seen sitting on the floor and standing in the back as the then-dark-haired activist addresses them.    The compelling picture can be found in the senators biographical video on his campaign website. At the University of Chicago, Sanders says as the photo fades in and out, I got involved in the civil rights movement. We ended up engaging in a sit-in demonstration. Its on the campaigns Tumblr feed. As the Civil Rights Movement grew, Bernie led a sit-in to desegregate off-campus housing at the University of Chicago, reads the timeline under 1962. And Sanders used it in a stirring 2013 video to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. I remember the day very well and I remember the moment, the period well, he says as the photo passes by, because up at the University of Chicago, where I was then going to school, we were working with young people in the South.    Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders recalls his personal history with activism in a campaign video. (Bernie 2016)    But thats not Bernie Sanders in the photo. It is Bruce Rappaport.    Classmates of the two men started raising concerns about the discrepancy last year. According to Time, four University of Chicago alumni told the magazine in November that they believed the man to be Rappaport, also a student activist, who died in 2006. At the time of the story, the photo was still captioned as Bernie Sanders in the University of Chicagos photo archive. But the pictures caption has since been changed.    Alumni who knew them well said that was Bruce Rappaport [pictured], a University of Chicago official told me Wednesday. The caption was changed in January. This was just a case of honest misattribution, the official told me.    When Time asked Sanders campaign strategist Tad Devine about the photo discrepancy last year, he said, This is the first weve heard of it. As we sit here right now I still think thats Bernie. But well take a look at it. Three months later, here is what Devine told me when I asked him about the discrepancy and whether the campaign planned to remove the photo from the Tumblr feed or the campaign video:    When I originally used this photo back in May/June is was because the U of Chicago had identified the guy standing as Bernie. It certainly looked like him, and Bernie remembers being there as part of the protests. Then Time Magazine months later raised a question about whether that was him standing. To be honest we are not 100% sure if it is or not. As to why we would leave it in the video, I think it is an accurate representative scene of something that he was part of at the time, so I did not think I needed to redo the video we made months ago. There is no dispute he was there and part of these protests, just like there is no dispute that he was at the March on Washington, where we again used representative visual images.    Sanderss supporters have been posting that picture everywhere to imply that he was in the trenches fighting for the rights of African Americans when rival Hillary Clinton was a Republican-supporting Goldwater Girl. Never mind she backed Democrats in the subsequent presidential elections. Or that her civil rights bona fides go back to 1972, when she investigated school discrimination in Dothan, Ala., for the Childrens Defense Fund.        Bernie Sanders (standing, right), member of the Committee on Racial Equalitys steering committee, stands next to University of Chicago President George Beadle, who addresses a CORE meeting on housing sit-ins. (Danny Lyon/Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library)    Sanderss involvement in the civil rights movement and his commitment to equal justice are not in question. Another old picture that appears in campaign literature and video of student-activist Sanders with the university president is not in question. That most definitely is him. Whats at issue is Sanderss misleading use of a photograph to burnish already solid credentials. For a candidate who garnered 92 percent of New Hampshire Democratic voters who said the most important trait for a candidate was that he or she be honest, the least his campaign could do is remove that photo from its Tumblr feed and stop physically placing him where he existed only in spirit.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/saudi-arabia-eases-guardianship-rules-against-women/http://newsweekme.com/saudi-move-relax-male-guardianship-welcomed-womens-advocates/,mtrue," By Heba Kanso    BEIRUT, May 5 A move by Saudi Arabia to give women more control over their life choices by further relaxing a controversial male guardian system was tentatively welcomed on Friday as another small step for women in the conservative kingdom.    Saudi Arabia is well known as one of the worlds most gender-segregated nations, where women live under the supervision of a male guardian, cannot drive, and in public must wear head-to-toe black garments.    Women need approval from a man to travel, study and get some health treatments.    However local media outlets reported this week that the king of Saudi Arabia has issued an order allowing women to benefit from government services such as education and healthcare without getting the consent of a male guardian.    This means women could, in some circumstances, study and access hospital treatment, work in the public and private sector and represent themselves in court without consent of a male guardian, said Maha Akeel, a womens rights campaigner and a director at Jeddah-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation.    Now at least it opens the door for discussion on the guardian system, Akeel told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Women are independent and can take care of themselves.    This comes as the latest in a series of moves in Saudi Arabia to include women more in the workforce as the kingdom moves to diversify its economy and cut reliance on oil.    The trend started in 2011 when the late King Abdullah allowed women onto the government advisory Shura Council. Women can now vote in municipal elections, work in some retail and hospitality jobs and were allowed to compete in the Olympics for the first time in 2012.    However Saudi Arabia was still ranked 141 of 144 countries in the 2016 Global Gender Gap, a World Economic Forum study on how women fare in economic and political participation, healthand education.    The system of make guardianship, which requires women to obtain permission from a guardian father, husband, or son to travel, study or marry is an impediment to realising womens rights, say rights groups.    Male guardianship is un-Islamic and humiliating for women, said Akeel. Some (men) take advantage of this male guardianship for their own benefit and abuse it.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/scientists-drug-regenerates-teeth/https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39654,mixture," Study design    The purpose of this study was to investigate whether natural dentine repair could be enhanced by stimulating the formation of reparative dentine. Adult CD1 wild-type mouse first molars were used and damage stimulated by controlling drilling (see below). The drugs of choice and vehicle were based on previous reports in the literature and also translational potential into a simple, cost effective dental therapy.    In order to evaluate the reparative capacity of the drugs, six to nine teeth were evaluated per time point and a sample size of 2030 teeth per group was used for the in vivo gene expression assay. The reparative time points used in this study were in accordance with UK Home Office animal regulations. This study was not blind and sample selection was not random.    Injury Protocol    All animals used in this study were handled in accordance to UK Home Office Regulations project license 70/7866 and personal license I6517C8EF. Experimental procedures were approved by the Kings College Ethical Review Process. The mice were anaesthetized with a solution made with Hypnorm (Fentanyl/fluanisone - VetaPharma Ltd.), sterile water and Hypnovel (Midazolam - Roche) in the ratio 1:2:1 at the rate of 10 ml/kg intraperitonially. A rounded carbide burr FG 1/4 coupled to a high speed hand piece was used to access the dentine of the mouse superior molar teeth. Once the burr cut exposed the dentine, a 30G needle was used to penetrate the pulp. In order to protect the pulp from external contamination and stimulate dentine repair, the injury was capped either with ProRoot Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) (Maillfer Dentsply), or Kolspon (Fish Collage Type 1- Eucare Ltd) alone, or in association with 50 nM BIO (SIGMA), 5 M CHIR99021 (SIGMA), or 50 nM Tideglusib (SIGMA) dissolved and diluted in DMSO, in contact with the pulp. A layer of 3 M Ketac-Cem Radiopaque was used as a capping material to seal the injured site. The damage was performed on the two upper first molars. For incisor damage a fine needle was inserted through the mouse lower tooth into the pulp. Post-op the mice were given Vetergesic (Buprenorphine Ceva) at the rate of 0.3 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection as analgesic. The animals were sacrificed after 1 day, 4 weeks and 6 weeks.    Cytotoxity assay    17IA4 cells were plated in 96 well plates at 20,000 cells/cm2 and incubated (37 C, 5% CO 2 /95% air, 100% humidity) for 24 hrs using standard culture medium. Thereafter, the medium was replaced with conditioned (drugs + media) and control media (media alone) for another 24 hrs. (10 l of drug in DMSO + 90 l of media resulting on the following concentrations BIO: 200, 100, 50 nM; CHIR99021: 10, 8, 5 M; Tideglusib: 200, 100, 50 nM). To determine the cell metabolic activity, MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma) was added to the controls and the conditioned media after 24 hrs. The resulting formazan product was then dissolved in 200 l of dimethyl sulfoxide per well (DMSO, Sigma). A colorimetric plate reader (Thermo Multiskan Ascent 354 microplate reader) was used to read the absorbance at 540 nm with background subtraction at 630 nm.    In vitro drug release    17IA4 cells were plated in 24-well plates and incubated (37 C, 5% CO 2 /95% air, 100% humidity) for 24 h using standard culture medium. FalconTM cell culture inserts for use with 24-well plates (3 m pore size) were placed in the wells carrying 96 mm2 Kolspon cubes either dry or soaked in 30 l of the drug optimal concentration for 15 and 30 minutes, 1, 6, and 12 hours. The cells were collected with TRIzol and stored at 20 C.    Pulp collection    P21 mice had their superior first molars drilled according to the drilling protocol. Tooth pulp tissue was collected according to the experiment time course after injury. The superior first molars were extracted using a 21 G needle as an elevator to lift them from the alveolar bone and the extracted molars were kept in ice cold PBS. Using a 23 scalpel blade the molars were separated at the crown-root junction, so that the pulp chamber could be visualized. Using a 0.6 mm straight tip tweezer the pulp was gently scraped from the pulp chamber and the root canal. The pulp was then placed into cold Sigma RNAlater and stored at 80 C.    Q-PCR    RNA was extracted from the cells in culture with the drugs in after 15, and 30 mins, 1, 6, and 12 hours, and also from the dental pulp collected from CD1 P21 wild-type mice without injury (control) and 1 day after injury using TRIzol. (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as recommended by the manufacturer. The RNA was quantified using Nanodrop and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Beta-actin was used as housekeeping gene (Forward- GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG, Reverse- CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCTGT) and Axin2 was the read-out for Wnt pathway activity (Forward-TGACTCTCCTTCCAGATCCCA, Reverse-TGCCCACACTAGGCTGACA).    MicroCT/mineral analysis    Mice upper molars were dissected and fixed with PFA 4% overnight and scanned using a Bruker Skyscan1272 micro-CT scanner. After scanning, Microview software programme (GE) was used for visualization and analysis. Two dimensional (2D) images were obtained from micro-CT cross-sectional images of superior first molar internal part, to evaluate if the drilling was successful and mineral formation. In order to assay tissue mineral content a ROI of X = 0.2 mm, Y = 0.4 mm, and Z = 0.2 mm was set as standard for all the samples and the mineral analysis was performed. The region measured comprised only of the injury site. ROI complete filled with mineral = 0.0017 mg.

People use the taps straight after doing their business, making the tap a real germ magnet. And the tap gets touched again after people are finished washing their hands. The same goes for electric hand dryers. In fact, a recent study showed that electric hand dryers spread bacteria to a large extent.    As a first point, the electric hand dryers stir up the air in the room and thereby launch the microbes and viral particles into the air and all over the room. Secondly, after washing hands, there are often residual germs, which instead of being removed by the hand driers, actually get spread all the more. In general, the greater the airflow, the greater the germ problem. The best alternative is paper towels. They get rid of significantly more germs.    So there you go, from now on you might look upon toilet paper more critically than the toilet seat itself.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-taps-outspoken-climate-denier-to-oversee-epa-transition-team/http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060043378,ftrue," Donald Trump has selected one of the best-known climate skeptics to lead his U.S. EPA transition team, according to two sources close to the campaign.    Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, is spearheading Trump's transition plans for EPA, the sources said.    The Trump team has also lined up leaders for its Energy Department and Interior Department teams. Republican energy lobbyist Mike McKenna is heading the DOE team; former Interior Department solicitor David Bernhardt is leading the effort for that agency, according to sources close to the campaign.    Ebell is a well-known and polarizing figure in the energy and environment realm. His participation in the EPA transition signals that the Trump team is looking to drastically reshape the climate policies the agency has pursued under the Obama administration. Ebell's role is likely to infuriate environmentalists and Democrats but buoy critics of Obama's climate rules.    Ebell, who was dubbed an ""elegant nerd"" and a ""policy wonk"" by Vanity Fair, is known for his prolific writings that question what he calls climate change ""alarmism."" He appears frequently in the media and before Congress. He's also chairman of the Cooler Heads Coalition, a group of nonprofits that ""question global warming alarmism and oppose energy-rationing policies.""    Ebell appears to relish criticism from the left.    In a biography submitted when he testified before Congress, he listed among his recognitions that he had been featured in a Greenpeace ""Field Guide to Climate Criminals,"" dubbed a ""misleader"" on global warming by Rolling Stone and was the subject of a motion to censure in the British House of Commons after Ebell criticized the United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser for his views on global warming.    More recently, Ebell has called the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan for greenhouse gases illegal and said that Obama joining the Paris climate treaty ""is clearly an unconstitutional usurpation of the Senate's authority.""    Advertisement    He told Vanity Fair in 2007, ""There has been a little bit of warming ... but it's been very modest and well within the range for natural variability, and whether it's caused by human beings or not, it's nothing to worry about.""    Ebell's views appear to square with Trump's when it comes to EPA's agenda. Trump has called global warming ""bullshit"" and he has said he would ""cancel"" the Paris global warming accord and roll back President Obama's executive actions on climate change (ClimateWire, May 27).    Leading the Trump DOE team: GOP hired gun McKenna.    The president of MWR Strategies is well known in Republican energy circles. He was director of policy and external affairs for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality under then-Gov. George Allen (R) and was an external relations specialist at the Energy Department during the George H.W. Bush administration.    His lobbying clients in 2016 include Koch Companies Public Sector LLC, Southern Company Services, Dow Chemical Co. and Competitive Power Ventures Inc., according to public disclosures.    And heading Interior's transition effort is Bernhardt, co-chairman of the Natural Resources Department at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.    He served as Interior's solicitor during the George W. Bush administration after holding several other high-ranking jobs at the department.    In addition to the EPA, Interior and DOE team leaders, GOP energy expert Mike Catanzaro is also working on energy policy for the Trump transition team (Greenwire, Sept. 14).    During the Obama transition in 2008, a relatively small team was assembled ahead of the election in order to map out broad policy goals.    Following the election, the operation expanded dramatically and teams were dispatched to work out of agencies to gather information from political staffers and career officials, write flurries of memos and compile thick binders of intelligence to hand over to the incoming leadership (Greenwire, Aug. 19, 2016).

This is one of the most effective ways to reduce discrimination in law enforcement and it needs to be beefed up and increased to cover as many of the 18,000-plus local law enforcement jurisdictions.    [lz_jwplayer video= iPQ16HTo ads=true]    Advertisement    That was United Nations Rapporteur Maina Kai on July 27, a representative of the U.N. Human Rights Council, who on the tail-end of touring the U.S., endorsed a little-known and yet highly controversial practice by the Justice Department to effect a federal takeover of local police and corrections departments.    The Obama administration has been pursuing the federal takeover of local police right under Congress nose and Republicans in Congress were apparently unaware it was happening.    The consent decrees are already being implemented in Newark, New Jersey; Miami, Florida; Los Angeles, California; Ferguson, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois; and other municipalities.    Advertisement    Heres how it works: the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice files a lawsuit in federal court against a city, county, or state, alleging constitutional and civil rights violations by the police or at a corrections facility. It is done under 42 U.S.C. 14141, a section of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, granting the attorney general the power to prosecute law enforcement misconduct. The municipality then simply agrees to the judicial finding without contest and the result is a wide-reaching federal court order that imposes onerous regulations on local police.    The federal court orders are designed to undo Rudy Giuliani-style policing tactics that were effective at reducing crime in big cities in the 1990s and 2000s.    In short, the much-feared nationalization of local police departments is already being initiated by the Obama administrations Justice Department. And somehow nobody noticed.    Close More from LifeZette    Federal requirements include how searches are conducted, what constitutes legitimate use of force, the mandatory use of on-body cameras by the police, and so forth. The agreements impose years-long compliance review regimes, implementation deadlines, and regular reviews by federal bureaucrats. This makes local police directly answerable to the Civil Rights Division at the DOJ.    One example includes a 77-page March 30 consent decree between the department and the City of Newark, New Jersey, that resulted from a 2011 investigation, a 2014 series of findings by the Civil Rights Division, and then finally a federal lawsuit alleging police misconduct in the U.S. District Court in the District of New Jersey.    The original complaint alleged that the Newark Police Department (NPD) has engaged in a pattern or practice of constitutional violations in its stop and arrest practices, responses to individuals exercise of their rights under the First Amendment, uses of force, and theft by officers. The investigation also revealed that the pattern or practice of constitutional violations stems in part from deficiencies in NPDs systems that are designed to prevent and detect misconduct, including its systems for reviewing force and investigating complaints regarding officer conduct.    Advertisement    The city of Newark, via the consent decree, agreed to the allegations and to implement a comprehensive and agency-wide policies and procedures that are consistent with and incorporate all substantive requirements of this agreement, including rules on stops, searches, use of force, etc. The city has two years to implement, with the full agreement lasting five years. Meaning even if the political parties change power in the city of Newark, the new mayor and city council would still be required to implement the court order.    [lz_table title=U.S. Cities with Active DOJ Consent Decrees source=Americans for Limited Government]City,State,Police Force    Chicago,IL,11944    Los Angeles,CA,10000    Miami,FL,1259    Ferguson,MO,54    [/lz_table]    These consent decrees are in essence regulations. That, is, without the niceties of administrative procedures requirements, public comments, or even any congressional oversight.    Advertisement    Remarkably, congressional offices contacted by this author were generally unaware of the regulation of local policing via DOJ consent decrees with cities even though the agreements have been implemented for years. Not a single hearing or word of protest has occurred on this topic.    The lack of oversight is pathetic enough but to make matters even worse, this could actually be the first step in a new wide-ranging body of federal rules on local police.    The Department of Housing and Urban Development regulation Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) actually originated as a consent decree in 2009 against Westchester County, New York, requiring affordable housing units to be built in the county. Afterward, Republican Robert Astorino was elected county executive and yet was still required to implement the court order.    Advertisement    Westchester became the basis for AFFH, where every city and county in the country that accepts any part of $3 billion of annual community development block grants to 1,200 recipient cities and counties now has to comply with HUDs dictates ononing along racial and income guidelines.    [lz_ndn video=31158785]    DOJ may very well end up doing the same thing with the local police that is, if Congress does not wise up to whats really happening and defund implementation of 42 U.S.C. 14141. This is dangerous. What is most chilling is how far along the Obama Justice Department is in this process. The breadth of regulation here shatters any notion of local governance or federalism. The Obama administration has been pursuing the federal takeover of local police right under Congress nose and Republicans in Congress were apparently unaware it was happening.    Advertisement    No doubt the practice would continue under a Hillary Clinton administration too. Do you want a Clinton Justice Department running your local police force? That is how important the election in November suddenly becomes with law and order already hanging in the balance and police being targeted by domestic terrorists in the slayings in Dallas and Baton Rouge.    As Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning noted in a statement calling attention to the U.N.s interest in the DOJ program and urging Congress to act, The fact that the U.N. Human Rights Council which includes some of the worst abusers of human rights in the world that hate the U.S. is cheering for this DOJ national takeover of the police should tell members everything they need to know. Its time to support local police, not render them impotent via federal restrictions against maintaining law and order. No less than the very existence of local government is at stake.

Some 3.5 million more people are registered to vote in the U.S. than are alive among Americas adult citizens. Such staggering inaccuracy is an engraved invitation to voter fraud.    The Election Integrity Project of Judicial Watch a Washington-based legal-watchdog group analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureaus 20112015 American Community Survey and last months statistics from the federal Election Assistance Commission. The latter included figures provided by 38 states. According to Judicial Watch, eleven states gave the EAC insufficient or questionable information. Pennsylvanias legitimate numbers place it just below the over-registration threshold.    Advertisement    Advertisement    My tabulation of Judicial Watchs state-by-state results yielded 462 counties where the registration rate exceeded 100 percent. There were 3,551,760 more people registered to vote than adult U.S. citizens who inhabit these counties.    Advertisement    Thats enough over-registered voters to populate a ghost-state about the size of Connecticut, Judicial Watch attorney Robert Popper told me.    These 462 counties (18.5 percent of the 2,500 studied) exhibit this ghost-voter problem. These range from 101 percent registration in Delawares New Castle County to New Mexicos Harding County, where there are 62 percent more registered voters than living, breathing adult citizens or a 162 percent registration rate.    Washingtons Clark County is worrisome, given its 154 percent registration rate. This includes 166,811 ghost voters. Georgias Fulton County seems less nettlesome at 108 percent registration, except for the number of Greater Atlantans, 53,172, who compose that figure.    But Californias San Diego County earns the enchilada grande. Its 138 percent registration translates into 810,966 ghost voters. Los Angeles Countys 112 percent rate equals 707,475 over-registrations. Beyond the official data that it received, Judicial Watch reports that LA County employees informed us that the total number of registered voters now stands at a number that is a whopping 144 percent of the total number of resident citizens of voting age.    Advertisement    All told, California is a veritable haunted house, teeming with 1,736,556 ghost voters. Judicial Watch last week wrote Democratic secretary of state Alex Padilla and authorities in eleven Golden State counties and documented how their election records are in shambles.    Advertisement    Californias voting rolls are an absolute mess that undermines the very idea of clean elections, said Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton in a statement. It is urgent that California take reasonable steps to clean up its rolls. We will sue if state officials fail to act.    Ronald Reagans California has devolved into a reliably far-Left stronghold. While pristine voter rolls should be a given in a constitutional republic with democratic elections, even that improvement might be too little to make Americas most populous state competitive in presidential elections.    The same cannot be said for battleground states, in which Electoral College votes can be decided by incredibly narrow margins. Consider the multitude of ghost voters in:     Colorado: 159,373     Florida: 100,782     Iowa: 31,077     Michigan: 225,235     New Hampshire: 8,211     North Carolina: 189,721     Virginia: 89,979    (For a deeper dive into these data, please download my spreadsheet here .)    President Donald J. Trumps supporters might be intrigued to learn that Hillary Clintons margins of victory in Colorado (136,386) and New Hampshire (2,736) were lower than the numbers of ghost voters in those states. Clintons fans should know that Trump won Michigan (10,704) and North Carolina (173,315) by fewer ballots than ghost voters in those states.    Its past time to exorcise ghost voters from the polls.    Perhaps these facts will encourage Democrats to join the GOP-dominated effort to remove ineligible felons, ex-residents, non-citizens, and dead people from the voter rolls for all contests, not just presidential races.    Advertisement    When you have an extremely large number of stale names on the voter rolls in a county, it makes voter fraud much easier to commit, Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R., Kan.), co-chairman of President Trumps Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, told me. Its easier to identify a large number of names of people who have moved away or are deceased. At that point, if there is no photo-ID requirement in the state, those identities can be used to vote fraudulently.    In fact, CBSs Windy City affiliate last October compared local vote records with the Social Security Administrations master death file. In all, the channel concluded, the analysis showed 119 dead people have voted a total of 229 times in Chicago in the last decade. KCBSLos Angeles reported in May 2016 that 265 dead voters had cast ballots in southern California year after year.    Under federal law, the 1993 National Voter Registration Act and the 2002 Help America Vote Act require states to maintain accurate voter lists. Nonetheless, some state politicians ignore this law. Others go further: Governor Terry McAuliffe (D., Va.) vetoed a measure last February that would have mandated investigations of elections in which ballots cast outnumbered eligible voters.    Advertisement    Even more suspiciously, when GOP governor Rick Scott tried to obey these laws and update Floridas records, including deleting 51,308 deceased voters, Obamas Justice Department filed a federal lawsuit to stop him. Federal prosecutors claimed that Governor Scotts statewide efforts violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act, although it applies to only five of Floridas 67 counties. Thenattorney general Eric Holder and his team behaved as if Martin Luther King Jr. and the Freedom Riders fought so valiantly in order to keep cadavers politically active.    Whether Americans consider vote fraud a Republican hoax, a Democratic tactic, or something in between, everyone should agree that its past time to exorcise ghost voters from the polls.

Orono, MN For more than a year, we have been following the story of a Minnesota man, Jay Nygard, who is routinely risking jail time because he refuses to remove a wind turbine from his property. Nygard has been in and out of court over the years, and despite a short-lived victory last October, he was recently back in front of a judge facing a contempt of court charge for refusing a court order to remove the turbines from his property.    He did eventually remove the turbines, leaving only the cement bases because removing them would cause structural damage to their house. This was not good enough for the local government, who ignored the advice of three different engineers and demanded that they remove the bases, despite the risk of damaging the home.    This is all that remains of the windmill on Nygards property, a concrete footing, in the ground.    On Friday, Nygard was arrested and, according to his son, has been given six months in prison for refusing to remove the base.    According to Kahler Nygard, Jays son, his father even attempted to make peace with the county and compromise on a number of different issues, but they ignored his appeals.    The choices for my dad were to potentially destroy our foundation in the house or go to jail, he even offered an olive branch saying he would add an easement to the deed saying when the house is demolished the pad must be removed, but that was ignored also, Kahler said in an exclusive interview with The Free Thought Project.    The base was level with the ground and 4 feet cubed. We removed the top half of the concrete and used a metal cutting tool to remove the top half of the bolt assembly, rendering the structure unusable, Kahler explained.    They say that we have to remove to footing 100% and have it inspected by the city, which we have three different engineers all saying we should just leave it , one of them even does contract work for the city, he added.    Kahler said that although there are no ordinances against windmills, the county has a personal vendetta against his family.    Nygard has the right to do whatever he wants with his own property, but unfortunately in a democracy such as the United States, the property rights of an individual can be overridden according to the whims of politicians and the demands of uninvolved third parties.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/will-eating-alligator-save-wetlands/http://archive.is/edMYS,ffalse," American alligator 8 million years first protected Endangered Species Preservation Act in 66 Thehas remained nearly untouched by evolution for the last. It has hunted in the Southeastern wetlands as an apex predator, unaffected by sea levels or fluctuating temperatures. Nearly hunted to extinction by 1950, alligators were one of thespecies in 1962. They helped usher in the creation of theand by 1987, the alligator had become a rousing success story, pronounced fully recovered.With healthy levels returned, they demonstrated the programs effectiveness and future promise.    Today, the American alligators story is experiencing another plot twist.    Cavan The American alligator has been so protected, its now over-populated, said Nathan Richard, the executive chef ofin New Orleans. Hes both passionate and creative when it comes to cooking alligator hes done nose-to-tail preparations and hosted a vanishing wetlands supper series. For Richard, normalizing this protein on menus again is essential to protecting the Louisiana wetlands.    Too many alligators means too many fish and turtles being killed, he said, as we tucked into a bowl of his incredible curry piquant. Fried alligator tenderloin was slathered in a coconut sauce, made from hot red curry, fish sauce, soy, sliced ginger and gochujang paste. It was fragrant and spicy, bringing both moments of classic Louisiana flavor with intense notes of Southeast Asian cuisine. A perfectly crackled exterior resembled fried chicken, but the meat within was more akin in consistency to a super-tender octopus.    The interior at Cavan Sara Essex Bradley    This overpopulation also means a physical destruction of the marshes and the destruction of fishing traps and bait, said Richard. Thats a problem for the commercial fishermen. Our wetlands and marshes are our first line of defense against hurricanes, and without them, the flooding will become even more extreme.    While Richard is not the only man cooking gator in New Orleans, hes likely one of the few chefs of his caliber with such a hands-on approach to the animal in the wild.    Boating through the bayou in Louisiana Jenny Adams/Mic    Ive been hunting alligator since I was a kid growing up in Thibodaux, Louisiana, he said. Alligator is not only high-protein and low-fat, its also able to be sustainably sourced. The way we trap them, theres no pain or stress until the moment its killed. If you do it right, its very, very fast.    And if you do it wrong? I asked.    If you hunt alligator wrong, youre in big trouble, he said with a laugh. The sound fits his massive frame when hes not hunting gator, Richards is a volunteer fireman.    His exploration of new ways to cook alligator continues to excite guests whove come to love the meat. Its far beyond fried alligator bites in a basket a common sight in the city.    I learned from Australian crocodile recipes that you can do a baby-back ribs, he said. When I worked at Kingfish, I hosted nose-to-tail dinners. For those, I broke down an entire alligator and prepared each part differently. The cheek is delicious, but the liver is totally inedible. His grits and alligator grillades arrived on the Cavan menu this winter, with pan-fried cutlets cooked in bacon fat and braised in a reduction of celery, onions, bell pepper and garlic served over stone-ground, mascarpone and edam cheese grits.    Chef Nathan Richard at Cavan Cavan    I was eager to get a more up-close-and-personal look at the wetlands, and, admittedly, at the alligators. It turns out, a lot of people are similarly inclined and hunting (with professionals) is now a tourism activity.    Cypress Point Richard has become friends with a biologist and conservationist, Dr. Ray J. Matherne, the owner of a 1,700-acre wetland preserve about 30 minutes from New Orleans in Bayou Des Allemands. Matherne has spent a lifetime studying this ecosystem and today takes guests on tours, crawfish harvests. In September the only month alligator hunting is legal hell even take guests on two-day alligator hunts. Theres no place to stay directly on his property, but the drive isnt too long from New Orleans.    40% of all the wetlands in the U.S United States Geological Survey Louisianas 3 million acres of wetlands represent. According to the, they are being lost at a rate of 75 square kilometers annually. In Des Allemands and other bayous like it, you add in the overpopulation of an apex predator into the equation and the effects are deeply felt.    The wetlands at Cypress Point Jenny Adams/Mic    Thirty years ago, the demand for hides was tremendous, Matherne said, as we set out in a duo of small, battered outboards, not quite as long as a fully grown gator. But with the anti-fur movement, it has dropped considerably. Now, we hunt for population control and we hunt to save the wetlands. Theres no doubt hunting also benefits these bayou communities in other ways from the processors to locals who have their own, day-to-day issues with this overpopulation. Hes an expert on the area. You can see egrets, heron, ibis and even bald eagles nesting, he said. And we do a private alligator harvest, a crawfish harvest, fishing, duck hunting and bass fishing.    Mathernes preserve has Spanish moss dripping dreamily off cypress, gum, and oak trees. Its easy to forget we are here for a hunt the first of a two-day hunt is rather relaxing. We set traps using 12-foot long willow poles with a long, nylon rope tied to both ends. The poles are planted at a 45-degree angle deep into the mud. On the top of each pole, a piece of raw chicken hangs from a massive, metal hook dangling about a foot off the water.    The alligators begin their own hunt at dusk. Sniffing the rotten meat, they burst from the water to swallow the it whole, settling on the mud below to digest without noticing that theyve swallowed a hook and line, too.    The alligators from the hunt before they are processed Jenny Adams/Mic    Lets say we never came back, said Matherne on the second day of our hunt. It would do them no harm. An alligators digestive system is so acidic, its strong enough to dissolve a hubcap. In a matter of days, it would all dissolve, and the alligator would swim away.    A missing chicken alerts us we might have a gator. Richard stands in the boat, hauling the pole and line upwards. Another hunter stands alongside him with a rifle pointed at the water. Its mere seconds before an 11-foot alligator rises to the surface, suddenly furious and thrashing. The water is boiling and the boats are rocking with considerable force. Birds go screaming from the tree canopy. If you need anything to hunt an alligator, I realize, its an incredible trifecta of balance, bravery and marksmanship falling in would likely mean death. A quick bullet is fired into the center of alligators the head, and just like that, the swamp goes quiet again. ",Eating alligator in New Orleans will help save the wetlands of Louisiana.,test
